What’s New in Generative AI



Industries have been using AI tools like anomaly detection and classification for decades. But the new wave of generative AI uses language models as a fundamentally different approach, which can then be combined with traditional AI to solve business problems. That has resulted in a lot of excitement but also a lot of confusion about what is and what is not AI.

Generative AI is a language-based capability, offering an interface that nobody expected to happen this quickly in the AI evolution. In the past, when individuals spoke in a common language, it required a great deal of modeling and training data. But with open AI, these foundational models can translate language to code, to an action language, or to SQL. “It doesn’t circumvent what could be done with traditional AI,” Shah said, “but now you have a different toolkit in the box to be able to use language in capabilities, and fundamentally all of our customers speak in certain languages. And so this offers almost a new door of possibilities and features across the stack, across the industries, across various domains.” 



Miller added: “What you’re saying is we shouldn’t really talk about artificial intelligence, but maybe about artificial intelligences. The ways that we would use these different flavors of artificial intelligence really vary from one another. The types of problems or business applications that are right for generative AI might not be right for a strictly deep learning approach.” 



Where generative AI may be most helpful is in the interface layer with customer service, to help with natural language questions about data. “When I think about generative AI, it is an augmented assistant pattern to yourself as an individual, whether you’re in marketing or sales or at a SaaS (software as a service) company, whether it’s B2B or B2C,” Shah said. “It’s almost like an add-on assistant. A situation that might have taken a collections agent a long time—to find out which buyer to go to and personalize those types of workflows—is going to have a much more efficient process using AI, with the human element augmenting it to reduce that overhead.” 



Moving Beyond the Chatbot



To this point, many people’s interfaces with AI have been limited to a chatbot that pops up when they access a website.



“There’s a difference between a chatbot that is consumer-facing and is the only thing that the customer interacts with and an interface that is used by a customer service agent to retrieve information who delivers that information through a chat interface,” Miller said. “With new technologies, folks often start by trying to match the technological capability to, for example, the type of data that’s available. You might further then segment your customer base and determine which type of experience they’re going to have, and different technologies may be appropriate to deliver those different experiences.”



Companies can personalize the experience far more than what was possible even a year ago. The chatbot can be prompted to say here’s the person you’re speaking to and here’s their background, and even suggest the tone of communication. “You can tell it to be soft with the person, because they’re frustrated after waiting at an airport for five hours with their family,” Shah said. “That’s information that’s out there, but your system has to be designed in such a way as to have that information source as part of the dataset. We want to talk to customers, understand their pain points, then use a phased approach in embedding AI workflows into our products in a systematic way.” 



Enterprise value creation from generative AI is a different engineering exercise from a simple chatbot, requiring enterprise data far beyond the window of what Open AI or ChatGPT can do. “What I recommend people to do is start small, with use cases that have tangible business value, and really go out there and explore,” Shah said. “The worst thing you can do is to do nothing.” 



A simple thing like invoicing can be a helpful place to start. “When we look at our customers, their goal is to get paid faster,” he said. “That’s really in a nutshell what we try to do. When an invoice comes in, it has to get paid, and if it doesn’t get paid, it goes to collections. You can look at something like that and ask, ‘What if I knew using traditional AI that an invoice that might be forecasted to default?’ But I might know something about the buyer based on their communication, their emails, and the correspondence to feed a personalized recommendation to that buyer. It combines personalization content with enterprise data.” 



The Next Step in Accounts Receivable



Billtrust is building a unified accounts receivable system that can converge these functions to optimize the cache flows. The notion that the back-and-forth negotiating can actually take place in real time and perhaps even at the point of a transaction creates some very interesting potential opportunities. If, for example, a company’s agent and a seller’s agent are able to negotiate in real time, it’s also possible that financing offers could be included and evaluated in something near to real time. As the process becomes more templated, early adopters are likely to get an advantage. 



“If you’re looking for something that’s extremely atomic from a financial transaction perspective, you may not want a generative AI model going and actually processing a payment for you,” Shah said. “Where you do want it is in that interface layer that helps with customer service that helps with natural language questions on your data. There’s no doubt the different types of AI will eventually help you reduce manual overhead, simplify workflows, and ultimately deliver a better user experience.”

“If you’re looking for something that’s extremely atomic from a financial transaction perspective, you may not want a generative AI model going and actually processing a payment for you,” Shah said. “Where you do want it is in that interface layer that helps with customer service that helps with natural language questions on your data. There’s no doubt the different types of AI will eventually help you reduce manual overhead, simplify workflows, and ultimately deliver a better user experience.”

Although artificial intelligence has been one of the hot topics of the past year, it has been around for a very long time, dating to the 1940s. Over the past 20 to 30 years, there have been many permutations of what is often called traditional AI—and not just in the world of finance. Now, we’re living through a new boom of the technology in the form of generative AI.



Billtrust, a B2B order-to-cash and digital payments software leader based in New Jersey, has been at the forefront of these emerging AI solutions for all types of companies. In a recent PaymentsJournal podcast, Ahsan Shah, Senior Vice President of Data Analytics at Billtrust, sat down with Christopher Miller, Lead Analyst of Emerging Payments at Javelin Strategy & Research, to talk about where AI is making the most significant impact on businesses, now and into the future.

What’s New in Generative AI



Industries have been using AI tools like anomaly detection and classification for decades. But the new wave of generative AI uses language models as a fundamentally different approach, which can then be combined with traditional AI to solve business problems. That has resulted in a lot of excitement but also a lot of confusion about what is and what is not AI.



<img decoding=""async"" width=""728"" height=""90"" src=""https://b2161880.smushcdn.com/2161880/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Billtrust-001-003-Banner-Image.jpg?lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-434550"" style=""width:605px;height:auto"" srcset=""https://b2161880.smushcdn.com/2161880/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Billtrust-001-003-Banner-Image.jpg?lossy=1&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 728w, https://b2161880.smushcdn.com/2161880/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Billtrust-001-003-Banner-Image-300x37.jpg?lossy=1&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px"" />


Generative AI is a language-based capability, offering an interface that nobody expected to happen this quickly in the AI evolution. In the past, when individuals spoke in a common language, it required a great deal of modeling and training data. But with open AI, these foundational models can translate language to code, to an action language, or to SQL. “It doesn’t circumvent what could be done with traditional AI,” Shah said, “but now you have a different toolkit in the box to be able to use language in capabilities, and fundamentally all of our customers speak in certain languages. And so this offers almost a new door of possibilities and features across the stack, across the industries, across various domains.” 



Miller added: “What you’re saying is we shouldn’t really talk about artificial intelligence, but maybe about artificial intelligences. The ways that we would use these different flavors of artificial intelligence really vary from one another. The types of problems or business applications that are right for generative AI might not be right for a strictly deep learning approach.” 



Where generative AI may be most helpful is in the interface layer with customer service, to help with natural language questions about data. “When I think about generative AI, it is an augmented assistant pattern to yourself as an individual, whether you’re in marketing or sales or at a SaaS (software as a service) company, whether it’s B2B or B2C,” Shah said. “It’s almost like an add-on assistant. A situation that might have taken a collections agent a long time—to find out which buyer to go to and personalize those types of workflows—is going to have a much more efficient process using AI, with the human element augmenting it to reduce that overhead.” 



Moving Beyond the Chatbot



To this point, many people’s interfaces with AI have been limited to a chatbot that pops up when they access a website.



“There’s a difference between a chatbot that is consumer-facing and is the only thing that the customer interacts with and an interface that is used by a customer service agent to retrieve information who delivers that information through a chat interface,” Miller said. “With new technologies, folks often start by trying to match the technological capability to, for example, the type of data that’s available. You might further then segment your customer base and determine which type of experience they’re going to have, and different technologies may be appropriate to deliver those different experiences.”



Companies can personalize the experience far more than what was possible even a year ago. The chatbot can be prompted to say here’s the person you’re speaking to and here’s their background, and even suggest the tone of communication. “You can tell it to be soft with the person, because they’re frustrated after waiting at an airport for five hours with their family,” Shah said. “That’s information that’s out there, but your system has to be designed in such a way as to have that information source as part of the dataset. We want to talk to customers, understand their pain points, then use a phased approach in embedding AI workflows into our products in a systematic way.” 



Enterprise value creation from generative AI is a different engineering exercise from a simple chatbot, requiring enterprise data far beyond the window of what Open AI or ChatGPT can do. “What I recommend people to do is start small, with use cases that have tangible business value, and really go out there and explore,” Shah said. “The worst thing you can do is to do nothing.” 



A simple thing like invoicing can be a helpful place to start. “When we look at our customers, their goal is to get paid faster,” he said. “That’s really in a nutshell what we try to do. When an invoice comes in, it has to get paid, and if it doesn’t get paid, it goes to collections. You can look at something like that and ask, ‘What if I knew using traditional AI that an invoice that might be forecasted to default?’ But I might know something about the buyer based on their communication, their emails, and the correspondence to feed a personalized recommendation to that buyer. It combines personalization content with enterprise data.” 



The Next Step in Accounts Receivable



Billtrust is building a unified accounts receivable system that can converge these functions to optimize the cache flows. The notion that the back-and-forth negotiating can actually take place in real time and perhaps even at the point of a transaction creates some very interesting potential opportunities. If, for example, a company’s agent and a seller’s agent are able to negotiate in real time, it’s also possible that financing offers could be included and evaluated in something near to real time. As the process becomes more templated, early adopters are likely to get an advantage. 



“If you’re looking for something that’s extremely atomic from a financial transaction perspective, you may not want a generative AI model going and actually processing a payment for you,” Shah said. “Where you do want it is in that interface layer that helps with customer service that helps with natural language questions on your data. There’s no doubt the different types of AI will eventually help you reduce manual overhead, simplify workflows, and ultimately deliver a better user experience.”

Banks Battle to Stay Ahead of APP Fraud



APP fraud is a scheme by which a criminal deceives a consumer or a business into sending funds to a fraudulent account. These bad actors target their victims to part with their money through social engineering or impersonating a real person or an existing company.



Banks face tremendous pressure to stop these malicious attacks. The problem is that these increasingly sophisticated attacks are rapidly outpacing the FIs’ ability to detect and mitigate such fraud.



“What makes it challenging is that most of the bank systems that are in play today have been geared towards monitoring the sender rather than monitoring the receiver,” Scola said.



“That puts a lot more onus on the banks to shift their position and start to look at the receiving end of that transaction, which is a change in posture for the industry as a whole.”



APP fraud is essentially a two-fold problem, according to Kitten. It has a technical component and a social engineering component, making it an incredibly complex fraud tactic to overcome.



“There is obviously a technology piece that plays a role here, but there’s also a human element, a psychological piece that’s a big part of this,” Kitten said.



“I think part of what makes resolving the scam issue so challenging, because as you know from the FI’s perspective, these are legitimate transactions. These are transactions that the users are actually authorizing.



“These are authorized push payments, but because they’ve been manipulated, socially engineered in some way, and they result in fraud. So it’s a huge challenge, and it’s one that is only going to continue to get worse.”



Why Inbound Transaction Processing is a Game-Changer in Tackling APP Fraud



Banks have typically focused on outbound transaction processing, which monitors transactions originating from the sender. However, inbound transaction processing enables banks to monitor and examine transactions originating from the recipient’s account, where the bad activity in cases of APP fraud is actually instigated. This is where banks must redirect their focus to combat such fraud.



“It becomes much more effective to monitor the receiving accounts than it is the sending accounts,” Scola said. “Because as we look across the industry and the activity that’s going through various payment rails, you can start to see similar types of transactions, similar amounts, similar times for these transactions that I think help reflect the fact that they are fraudulent.



“It’s working to identify those commonalities on the inbound side that make the identification of that fraudulent activity possible.”



Inbound transaction screening can be a dependable way to detect fraud, such as anomalies in these transactions.



“But I think that some of those things that we’ve talked about in the industry for a long time, some of those tried-and-true methods can really be things that we can fall back on,” Kitten said. “I think back to the days of ACH account takeover and wire fraud. What were some of the indicators of compromise there?



“We looked at the time of day of the transaction, the transaction, transaction amount, if you know this was a transaction that perhaps has been initiated by a sender that doesn’t normally have interactions with this particular recipient. Some of those types of things can assist.”



How Banks Can Be More Proactive in Preventing APP Fraud



With the speed and nature of faster payments, banks are simply not fully equipped to detect fraud. More banks are leveraging emerging technologies to revolutionize how they detect APP fraud.



“On the bank’s side, beyond relying on clients to identify [APP fraud], there are some other mechanisms that are starting to come into more popular use amongst the banks,” Scola said. “And that is the application of AI.



“I know everybody mentions AI is the solution to all things these days. But I really believe particularly in the payment side that fraud is the ultimate use case for AI. And the reason is, as Tracy mentioned, you are dealing with instant payment systems. They are irrevocable payments. They are happening within seconds.



“The only way you can successfully monitor that data at that speed is through the application of AI and really looking for commonalities among the payment activity that’s going through the network.”



Another powerful tactic to mitigate APP fraud, Scola said, is for banks to collaborate. Fraudsters will initiate this type of fraud across many banks. If these banks were to share their data, they could easily detect the fraudsters’ activities as well as the accounts they are leveraging. That would allow banks to ultimately close them down and block the funds from further distribution.



Kitten noted that many fraudulent activities, and the losses incurred, go largely unreported. It could be due to embarrassment. But this, according to Kitten, is a mistake.



“My recommendation would be anytime there’s some kind of fraud or scam that’s reported that it be tracked in some way or another, so we have some kind of grasp as an industry on how much is being lost or how much is potentially being lost,” she said. “Then there’s an opportunity for these teams to get some budget to make some investments in actually thwarting this issue.”



For Fraud Prevention and Payments: Think Digital



Without question, real-time payments are here to stay. To remain key players in this increasingly competitive environment, banks need to focus on reinforcing their fraud detection solutions.



“A lot of the banks we see are now leveraging API integration to start tying together best-of-breed technologies, micro-service environments where they can start to piece those together, using APIs to integrate and increasingly leverage the cloud for scalability and speed in activities that were kind of anathema in the past for banks to move off premium bank accounts,” Scola said.



According to Kitten, there is still work to be done among banks when it comes to fortifying themselves against real-time payments-related fraud.



“A lot of the institutions that I spoke with nearing the end of last year had done nothing as far as technology advancements, improvements to address the launch of FedNow,” Kitten said. “So, this has been back-burned again. Budgets are tight. A lot of fraud issues to look at.”



“Unless they’re really seeing losses that they can track and put on a budget line, it’s difficult for them to really pay attention to it. But I think that’s going to quickly change as we see a lot of losses linked to faster payments.”

Faster payments have plenty of benefits for businesses and consumers, but the technology has also opened the door to a new breed of fraud: authorized push payment (APP) fraud. Banks and their customers have taken a considerable financial beating due to APP fraud. As losses soar, FIs are struggling to get a handle on this increasingly sophisticated fraud scheme, which could mean a loss of customers to competitors who are more invested in protecting their customers.



During a recent PaymentsJournal podcast, Dave Scola, CEO of Form3 (US), and Tracy Kitten, Director of Fraud and Security at Javelin Strategy & Research, discussed the formidable challenges banks face to mitigate APP fraud, why inbound transaction processing could be the catalyst for confronting APP fraud, and how banks can be the key change-makers in curbing this fraud scheme.

Banks Battle to Stay Ahead of APP Fraud



APP fraud is a scheme by which a criminal deceives a consumer or a business into sending funds to a fraudulent account. These bad actors target their victims to part with their money through social engineering or impersonating a real person or an existing company.



Banks face tremendous pressure to stop these malicious attacks. The problem is that these increasingly sophisticated attacks are rapidly outpacing the FIs’ ability to detect and mitigate such fraud.



“What makes it challenging is that most of the bank systems that are in play today have been geared towards monitoring the sender rather than monitoring the receiver,” Scola said.



“That puts a lot more onus on the banks to shift their position and start to look at the receiving end of that transaction, which is a change in posture for the industry as a whole.”



APP fraud is essentially a two-fold problem, according to Kitten. It has a technical component and a social engineering component, making it an incredibly complex fraud tactic to overcome.



“There is obviously a technology piece that plays a role here, but there’s also a human element, a psychological piece that’s a big part of this,” Kitten said.



“I think part of what makes resolving the scam issue so challenging, because as you know from the FI’s perspective, these are legitimate transactions. These are transactions that the users are actually authorizing.



“These are authorized push payments, but because they’ve been manipulated, socially engineered in some way, and they result in fraud. So it’s a huge challenge, and it’s one that is only going to continue to get worse.”



Why Inbound Transaction Processing is a Game-Changer in Tackling APP Fraud



Banks have typically focused on outbound transaction processing, which monitors transactions originating from the sender. However, inbound transaction processing enables banks to monitor and examine transactions originating from the recipient’s account, where the bad activity in cases of APP fraud is actually instigated. This is where banks must redirect their focus to combat such fraud.



“It becomes much more effective to monitor the receiving accounts than it is the sending accounts,” Scola said. “Because as we look across the industry and the activity that’s going through various payment rails, you can start to see similar types of transactions, similar amounts, similar times for these transactions that I think help reflect the fact that they are fraudulent.



“It’s working to identify those commonalities on the inbound side that make the identification of that fraudulent activity possible.”



Inbound transaction screening can be a dependable way to detect fraud, such as anomalies in these transactions.



“But I think that some of those things that we’ve talked about in the industry for a long time, some of those tried-and-true methods can really be things that we can fall back on,” Kitten said. “I think back to the days of ACH account takeover and wire fraud. What were some of the indicators of compromise there?



“We looked at the time of day of the transaction, the transaction, transaction amount, if you know this was a transaction that perhaps has been initiated by a sender that doesn’t normally have interactions with this particular recipient. Some of those types of things can assist.”



How Banks Can Be More Proactive in Preventing APP Fraud



With the speed and nature of faster payments, banks are simply not fully equipped to detect fraud. More banks are leveraging emerging technologies to revolutionize how they detect APP fraud.



“On the bank’s side, beyond relying on clients to identify [APP fraud], there are some other mechanisms that are starting to come into more popular use amongst the banks,” Scola said. “And that is the application of AI.



“I know everybody mentions AI is the solution to all things these days. But I really believe particularly in the payment side that fraud is the ultimate use case for AI. And the reason is, as Tracy mentioned, you are dealing with instant payment systems. They are irrevocable payments. They are happening within seconds.



“The only way you can successfully monitor that data at that speed is through the application of AI and really looking for commonalities among the payment activity that’s going through the network.”



Another powerful tactic to mitigate APP fraud, Scola said, is for banks to collaborate. Fraudsters will initiate this type of fraud across many banks. If these banks were to share their data, they could easily detect the fraudsters’ activities as well as the accounts they are leveraging. That would allow banks to ultimately close them down and block the funds from further distribution.



Kitten noted that many fraudulent activities, and the losses incurred, go largely unreported. It could be due to embarrassment. But this, according to Kitten, is a mistake.



“My recommendation would be anytime there’s some kind of fraud or scam that’s reported that it be tracked in some way or another, so we have some kind of grasp as an industry on how much is being lost or how much is potentially being lost,” she said. “Then there’s an opportunity for these teams to get some budget to make some investments in actually thwarting this issue.”



For Fraud Prevention and Payments: Think Digital



Without question, real-time payments are here to stay. To remain key players in this increasingly competitive environment, banks need to focus on reinforcing their fraud detection solutions.



“A lot of the banks we see are now leveraging API integration to start tying together best-of-breed technologies, micro-service environments where they can start to piece those together, using APIs to integrate and increasingly leverage the cloud for scalability and speed in activities that were kind of anathema in the past for banks to move off premium bank accounts,” Scola said.



According to Kitten, there is still work to be done among banks when it comes to fortifying themselves against real-time payments-related fraud.



“A lot of the institutions that I spoke with nearing the end of last year had done nothing as far as technology advancements, improvements to address the launch of FedNow,” Kitten said. “So, this has been back-burned again. Budgets are tight. A lot of fraud issues to look at.”

Zelle has laid the groundwork for what could be the massive P2P wave that has taken consumers and financial institutions by storm. Consumers want more convenient ways to pay, and this solution was the answer to many of their pain points. Consumers are now expecting their FIs to provide this type of P2P service as part of their regular offerings.



But many FIs are concerned about making the leap and possibly being on the hook for millions of dollars.



In a recent PaymentsJournal podcast,  Karen Buell, SVP of Operations, Banking and Fintech Solutions at Paymentus, and Kevin Libby, Fraud and Security Analyst at Javelin Strategy & Research, discuss the true story behind the headlines of these P2P fraud schemes, how can fraud be confronted, and how FIs can enter the P2P market armed with information and not fear.

P2P Expands Despite Growing Incidences of Fraud



With popular P2P platforms such as Zelle making the news, and with increased incidences of fraudulent attacks on consumers who have no recourse, it’s no wonder that many FIs are leery of adopting these payment platforms and offering them to customers.



“In 2022 alone, 28% of identity fraud scam victims that suffered a loss ended up losing that money through P2P transfers,” Libby said.



“That percentage is essentially flat year over year, but that’s a significant number of consumers, and from a consumer protection point of view, the fraud we’re seeing is enough to get the attention of consumer advocacy groups and regulators, and I think that’s why we’re seeing some of the headlines that we have.”



Headlines aside, consumers want an easier way to pay. They don’t always carry cash, and even if they do, it’s rarely the right amount. P2P payment platforms offer them a way to conceivably pay at any time, any place.



What FIs Can Do to Quell Consumer Fear Amid Growing P2P Fraud



The key to settling the apprehension customers feel about using P2P payment platforms is to provide education. Although fraud is still taking place, current statistics, according to Libby, show that “as a percentage of transactions, fraud on P2P platforms is very low.” In fact, reports have shown that the incidents are lower than 1% and even decreasing.



“FIs can do a lot to educate consumers that they don’t need to be afraid of these tools, of these payment methods, but they do need to be smart about using them,” Buell said.



Specifically, FIs should warn customers not to give away their banking credentials, as this seems to be a more common occurrence. Furthermore, implementing technology that protects consumers is essential for FIs to safeguard against and mitigate fraud.



Implementing challenge questions that only the consumer and the recipient would be familiar with would help offer that protection. This can also avoid situations where the sender might mistype a phone number or provide another type of vulnerability that can enable an account takeover to happen.



Preventive measures are key, as P2P payments are essentially real-time payments. They are immediate and final.



Buell emphasizes the importance of FIs’ role as a trusted partner, equipping customers with the critical knowledge they need to protect themselves and their accounts. Ultimately, FIs should empower them to use these platforms with confidence.



FIs should also educate their customers on what banks will never do or how they will never engage in a certain way with their consumers. For example, it’s important that FIs communicate with their customers that they will never ask for their PIN number or their one-time passcode.



“Analysts at Javelin, in our fraud and security practice, have been arguing for years that education is the cornerstone of any building plan designed for reducing fraud across most payment channels,” Libby said.



“I think that’s especially true for P2P fraud, particularly since many identity fraud scams culminate in P2P transfers. Susceptibility to scam victimization is largely about being educated about what’s out there, what scams are taking place, how to recognize them when you see them, and what to do if you believe you’ve been targeted.”



Knowledge is power. Educating consumers on some of the pitfalls of using these platforms better equips them to use the solutions carefully and responsibly.



“Another thing that FIs can do to reassure consumers is to let them know that they understand the fraud that’s taking place and that they’re employing and constantly refining very sophisticated fraud detection and prevention tools that are very effective at rooting out fraud and protecting their customers,” Libby said.



How FIs Can Address Their Own Concerns About P2P Fraud



With any new foray, FIs must proceed with a well-thought-out plan. Also, despite all the media coverage on P2P-related scams, FIs should not simply write off these solutions and avoid them at all costs. These platforms are clearly growing in popularity among consumers and are not going to disappear.




“They can’t be afraid of P2P, even if it’s one of the most targeted payment rails,” Buell said. “It’s important for the FIs to have a specific strategy, certainly an overarching payment strategy.”



Buell said fraud departments have been adept at confronting fraud for decades, but as the P2P space is relatively new, as are the fraudulent activities targeting it, the focus should be directed to getting educated on fraud as it applies to the P2P landscape.



She also recommends what her clients are currently doing: attending their local compliance chapters and AML groups to get familiar with all the latest fraud practices and trends. Staying informed is a key to staying ahead of the ever-growing and changing fraudulent tactics.



Moreover, although segmentation is a great tool for marketing purposes, it can also be leveraged for payment risk mitigation. Setting up different limits and rules for each customer avatar can help FIs further understand their customers and can help with the customization of fraud mitigation and fraud education.



“What financial institutions need to do is to bring to bear the technology that they have to intelligently leverage robust data sets to build models well trained at rooting out and arresting the fraud that’s attempted,” Libby said.



“They won’t be able to stop all of it, but they can make meaningful strides to that end. And in the case of P2 fraud scams, it will most likely require pulling in data from diverse sources, even from third parties that can provide insight into the context surrounding the P2P transactions.”



What Paymentus Can Do to Address These Issues



In forming a partnership with a technology solutions provider, communication is key. Buell said Paymentus reaches out to FIs, asking them for feedback on their specific fraud situations. If there is a “confirmed fraud situation feedback,” this information gets added to the Paymentus database.



Buell explained that there is constant juggling of the customer experience and the risk mitigation strategies of FIs. It is a tricky balance, for sure. But customers should always have as many payment method options as possible available to them.



“We don’t want it to be visible to the end user what’s happening, but we collaborate directly with our financial institutions, sharing best practices and providing them those tools to really dial up or down their strategy,” Buell said.



Paymentus also has relationship managers who meet with FIs quarterly or semiannually to check in with their payment strategy and determine how they are protecting their business. During these meetings, fraud mitigation tools and segmentation can be discussed, all with the purpose of becoming trusted advisors on the FIs’ journeys, with Paymentus offering advice and support along the way.



Trusted Partnerships Will Prove Essential in Mitigating P2P Fraud



As consumers continue to adopt digital payments, P2P payments will also increase in popularity. As new technologies grow, fraud follows closely behind.



Fraud will never go away entirely, so FIs must be prepared to meet it head-on. The key is partnering with trusted technology solution providers to not only mitigate risk but also continue enhancing the customer experience.

Zelle has laid the groundwork for what could be the massive P2P wave that has taken consumers and financial institutions by storm. Consumers want more convenient ways to pay, and this solution was the answer to many of their pain points. Consumers are now expecting their FIs to provide this type of P2P service as part of their regular offerings.



But many FIs are concerned about making the leap and possibly being on the hook for millions of dollars.



In a recent PaymentsJournal podcast,  Karen Buell, SVP of Operations, Banking and Fintech Solutions at Paymentus, and Kevin Libby, Fraud and Security Analyst at Javelin Strategy & Research, discuss the true story behind the headlines of these P2P fraud schemes, how can fraud be confronted, and how FIs can enter the P2P market armed with information and not fear.

P2P Expands Despite Growing Incidences of Fraud



With popular P2P platforms such as Zelle making the news, and with increased incidences of fraudulent attacks on consumers who have no recourse, it’s no wonder that many FIs are leery of adopting these payment platforms and offering them to customers.



“In 2022 alone, 28% of identity fraud scam victims that suffered a loss ended up losing that money through P2P transfers,” Libby said.



“That percentage is essentially flat year over year, but that’s a significant number of consumers, and from a consumer protection point of view, the fraud we’re seeing is enough to get the attention of consumer advocacy groups and regulators, and I think that’s why we’re seeing some of the headlines that we have.”



Headlines aside, consumers want an easier way to pay. They don’t always carry cash, and even if they do, it’s rarely the right amount. P2P payment platforms offer them a way to conceivably pay at any time, any place.



What FIs Can Do to Quell Consumer Fear Amid Growing P2P Fraud



The key to settling the apprehension customers feel about using P2P payment platforms is to provide education. Although fraud is still taking place, current statistics, according to Libby, show that “as a percentage of transactions, fraud on P2P platforms is very low.” In fact, reports have shown that the incidents are lower than 1% and even decreasing.



“FIs can do a lot to educate consumers that they don’t need to be afraid of these tools, of these payment methods, but they do need to be smart about using them,” Buell said.



Specifically, FIs should warn customers not to give away their banking credentials, as this seems to be a more common occurrence. Furthermore, implementing technology that protects consumers is essential for FIs to safeguard against and mitigate fraud.



Implementing challenge questions that only the consumer and the recipient would be familiar with would help offer that protection. This can also avoid situations where the sender might mistype a phone number or provide another type of vulnerability that can enable an account takeover to happen.



Preventive measures are key, as P2P payments are essentially real-time payments. They are immediate and final.



Buell emphasizes the importance of FIs’ role as a trusted partner, equipping customers with the critical knowledge they need to protect themselves and their accounts. Ultimately, FIs should empower them to use these platforms with confidence.



FIs should also educate their customers on what banks will never do or how they will never engage in a certain way with their consumers. For example, it’s important that FIs communicate with their customers that they will never ask for their PIN number or their one-time passcode.



“Analysts at Javelin, in our fraud and security practice, have been arguing for years that education is the cornerstone of any building plan designed for reducing fraud across most payment channels,” Libby said.



“I think that’s especially true for P2P fraud, particularly since many identity fraud scams culminate in P2P transfers. Susceptibility to scam victimization is largely about being educated about what’s out there, what scams are taking place, how to recognize them when you see them, and what to do if you believe you’ve been targeted.”



Knowledge is power. Educating consumers on some of the pitfalls of using these platforms better equips them to use the solutions carefully and responsibly.



“Another thing that FIs can do to reassure consumers is to let them know that they understand the fraud that’s taking place and that they’re employing and constantly refining very sophisticated fraud detection and prevention tools that are very effective at rooting out fraud and protecting their customers,” Libby said.



How FIs Can Address Their Own Concerns About P2P Fraud



With any new foray, FIs must proceed with a well-thought-out plan. Also, despite all the media coverage on P2P-related scams, FIs should not simply write off these solutions and avoid them at all costs. These platforms are clearly growing in popularity among consumers and are not going to disappear.




“They can’t be afraid of P2P, even if it’s one of the most targeted payment rails,” Buell said. “It’s important for the FIs to have a specific strategy, certainly an overarching payment strategy.”



Buell said fraud departments have been adept at confronting fraud for decades, but as the P2P space is relatively new, as are the fraudulent activities targeting it, the focus should be directed to getting educated on fraud as it applies to the P2P landscape.



She also recommends what her clients are currently doing: attending their local compliance chapters and AML groups to get familiar with all the latest fraud practices and trends. Staying informed is a key to staying ahead of the ever-growing and changing fraudulent tactics.



Moreover, although segmentation is a great tool for marketing purposes, it can also be leveraged for payment risk mitigation. Setting up different limits and rules for each customer avatar can help FIs further understand their customers and can help with the customization of fraud mitigation and fraud education.



“What financial institutions need to do is to bring to bear the technology that they have to intelligently leverage robust data sets to build models well trained at rooting out and arresting the fraud that’s attempted,” Libby said.



“They won’t be able to stop all of it, but they can make meaningful strides to that end. And in the case of P2 fraud scams, it will most likely require pulling in data from diverse sources, even from third parties that can provide insight into the context surrounding the P2P transactions.”



What Paymentus Can Do to Address These Issues



In forming a partnership with a technology solutions provider, communication is key. Buell said Paymentus reaches out to FIs, asking them for feedback on their specific fraud situations. If there is a “confirmed fraud situation feedback,” this information gets added to the Paymentus database.



Buell explained that there is constant juggling of the customer experience and the risk mitigation strategies of FIs. It is a tricky balance, for sure. But customers should always have as many payment method options as possible available to them.



“We don’t want it to be visible to the end user what’s happening, but we collaborate directly with our financial institutions, sharing best practices and providing them those tools to really dial up or down their strategy,” Buell said.



Paymentus also has relationship managers who meet with FIs quarterly or semiannually to check in with their payment strategy and determine how they are protecting their business. During these meetings, fraud mitigation tools and segmentation can be discussed, all with the purpose of becoming trusted advisors on the FIs’ journeys, with Paymentus offering advice and support along the way.



Trusted Partnerships Will Prove Essential in Mitigating P2P Fraud



As consumers continue to adopt digital payments, P2P payments will also increase in popularity. As new technologies grow, fraud follows closely behind.



Fraud will never go away entirely, so FIs must be prepared to meet it head-on. The key is partnering with trusted technology solution providers to not only mitigate risk but also continue enhancing the customer experience.

According to Duncan BNPL offers consumers a lot of convenience and the ability to break down their payment into smaller installments without paying interest. But, the current rules in place offer no protection for consumers struggling to make repayments—a growing issue that many are currently facing. 



Through the new regulations, BNPL lenders will need to “complete comprehensive credit reporting when customers sign up or increase their credit limit,” Duncan noted in a prepared statement. Once the regulations have been implemented, lenders will have some time to ensure they’re compliant and have the necessary processes in place. “Requiring ‘comprehensive credit reporting’ upon origination places BNPL right in line with credit cards, but we will have to wait and see what the details of these regulations will be when announced,” said Ben Danner, Senior Analyst for Credit and Commercial at Javelin Strategy & Research.

Fiserv amped up the payments servicing game in 2019 when they acquired First Data, another historic payment firm, and the company is stable, global, and continues to be a top innovator for Financial Services. Now with a market capitalization of $70 billion, Fiserv does business in more than 100 countries.



According to a Fiserv press release on the shift to the New York Stock Exchange, Frank Bisignano, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Fiserv, commented: “We are proud to partner with the NYSE, the world’s largest stock exchange, whose long tradition of listing industry-leading companies aligns well with our strategy to serve financial institutions and businesses of all sizes around the world. We are grateful for the partnership and support that the NASDAQ has provided us over many years with them.”



Ring the Bell, Frank



The press release states: “The Company expects to begin trading on the NYSE June 7, 2023.”  The new trading symbol, “FI” streamlines the prior Nasdaq code of FISV, ensuring that the “FI” remains part of the firm’s identity. Whether that FI relates to “Financial Institutions” or “Financial Innovation” remains to be seen, but both are core to the Fiserv legacy.



And, for Mr. Bisignano, the former CEO of First Data and COO of Chase, it is truly a day to ring the opening bell on Wall Street.

Unlike personal credit cards, corporate cards are issued to a company and often come with benefits such as better rewards and expense tracking. They can also provide employees with the purchasing power they need for business expenses without the hassle of reimbursement paperwork. By using a corporate card, employees can easily make purchases for travel, office supplies, and other company needs, freeing up their time to focus on more important tasks. What about corporate card misuse?



“With travel restricted, T&E payment fraud comes under more scrutiny.”




The title of this posted piece in PaymentsSource may seem to be slightly paradoxical, but the author quickly leads into the specific type of activity being reviewed. 



Travel: Corporate Card Misuse?



The subject matter is employee misconduct in using their corporate credit card outside the bounds of corporate policy, or directly misusing for personal expenses, which typically might occur during required travel. 




‘While the global coronavirus outbreak may be grounding corporate travel to a near standstill, leading travel companies and fintechs are continuing to hone AI-based payments platforms to reduce the problem of corporate travel fraud.’




The subsequent filing of expense reports for travel reimbursement can lag the actual event(s) by weeks, and often are a paper laden process with manual reviews for compliance.  Depending on the size of the company/department, the reviews may only be samples of the whole, leaving gaps of potential misuse that remain uncovered.  ‘



Back to the title, the author is supposing that since revenues are going to be down, travel budgets will be more highly scrutinized, and of course there is now a leading generation of tech that can help accomplish such efforts more quickly and effectively.




‘When the University of Portsmouth’s Centre for Counter Fraud Studies surveyed corporate travel fraud two years ago, it found that one in ten U.K. employees admitted to having submitted erroneous expenses claims, with such activity costing U.K. businesses in the region of £2 billion every year…However, many organizations believe that technology could make a significant difference. Last month, travel company TripActions launched its own corporate travel management and payments solution called TripActions Liquid. Companies that sign up to this platform are able to sync their corporate cards with online and mobile platforms which provide visibility into all transactions made on a business trip in real-time.’




Automating Expense Management



We would posture that automating the expense management process does a lot more than reduce ‘padding the report’, since those 90% +  of employees who do everything by the book also find manual filing to be incredibly annoying.  So, a company can have happier workers if they automate this tedious affair, something that in these times can  have a lot of value. Nonetheless, the author’s point is valid, so fiddling employees had better beware.




‘Streamlining corporate travel payments in this manner is developing into a niche but increasingly popular sector of the payments marketplace. Travelport also has a business travel payments platform available in partnership with U.K. fintech Conferma…Conferma predicts that the use of such platforms can minimize fraudulent behaviour because they are more convenient for employees as well as companies, thus encouraging travelers to act more honestly.’

The latest bit of fallout concerns crypto clients of Signature Bank, who have been given an April 5 deadline to close their accounts and move their money.



Flagstar Bank, a unit of New York Community Bancorp, stepped in with a deal to rescue Signature Bank a week after the March 12 collapse, but its move did not cover the crypto deposits. Hence, the April 5 deadline.



“Those are the deposits we are encouraging customers to move before April 5,” an FDIC spokesperson told Reuters. “If they have not by that day, we will mail checks to the address on record.”



Fail. Fail. Fail.



The failures of Silvergate Bank, Silicon Valley Bank, and Signature Bank came in quick succession:




Silvergate Bank, March 8: The California bank’s owner, Silvergate Capital Corp., announced that it would “wind down operations and voluntarily liquidate the bank in an orderly manner in accordance with applicable regulatory processes.” The bank, long a provider of financial services and lending to cryptocurrency developers and exchanges, had ridden high during the crypto bull market but saw its deposits fall precipitously during crypto winter.



Silicon Valley Bank, March 10: The bank, based in Santa Clara, Calif., suffered an old-fashioned bank run, with depositors pulling money at a prodigious rate and forcing the bank to sell bonds at a loss of $1.8 billion. That spooked depositors, who subsequently pulled even more money. The bank’s stock price plummeted, trading was halted, and the state of California stepped in and put it into receivership under the FDIC.



Signature Bank, March 12: The SVB shutdown rolled into New York-based Signature Bank, where customers withdrew billions of dollars. On March 10, the bank saw its stock decline 23%, the largest fall since it went public in 2004. Two days later, the bank failed.




The Particulars of Signature Bank



The Signature Bank failure, in particular, has drawn skepticism from some observers because the status of its balance sheet didn’t appear as perilous as the others. Former U.S. Rep. Barney Frank, a bank board member, suggested that regulators “wanted to send a very strong anti-crypto message.”



“The additional scrutiny that Signature is receiving is likely due to the Justice Department investigations claiming that (Signature) didn’t have sufficient processes and internal systems in place to monitor or detect money laundering,” said Joel Hugentobler, an analyst in Javelin Strategy & Research’s cryptocurrency practice. “Whether there actually was money laundering or not is yet to be determined.”

What’s clear is that the upending of the three crypto-friendly banks has added to the tumult in the industry. Hugentobler indicated that the most reliable on-ramps and off-ramps between cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies have eroded as a result.

With the upcoming launch of the FedNow Service, real-time payments continue to be a topic of discussion as demand grows among customers and businesses. More financial institutions are seeing the importance of enabling a range of real-time use cases to remain competitive and enhance the customer experience.

Where Real-Time Payments Stand in Availability 



Less than 10 years ago, real-time payments capabilities were limited to specialized and sometimes costly options, such as wire transfers. Since the launch of Zelle in 2017 and The Clearing House RTP® network a few years ago, real-time payments have become increasingly accessible.  



“Fiserv has about 1,200 financial institutions that have launched some form of real-time payments,” said Tim Ruhe, Vice President of Real-Time Payments at Fiserv. “And a lot of that is Zelle person-to-person payments. And now most of those financial institutions are looking at how they expand their real-time payments capability for consumers and businesses and how they connect to The Clearing House and/or the FedNow Service so they can launch a whole new generation of real-time payment capabilities.”  



Use cases grow when financial institutions partner with technology solution providers.  



“Here in the U.S., five years ago we launched the RTP network in order to provide true real-time payments all the way from the front-end customer experience to the back-end clearing and settlement,” said Keith Gray, Vice President of Strategic Partnerships at The Clearing House. “We have 300 banks and credit unions that are offering some form of real-time payments via RTP to their customers, receiving and sending as well in many cases. 



“That covers about 65% of the U.S. account base. If you’re a company using the network, you can reach about 65% of your customer base with a real-time payment right now. And that number continues to grow every week as we add new financial institutions through technology partners like Fiserv and many others. The types of use cases continue to grow and evolve. Things like same-day payroll, where you work your shift and get paid today, are a growing trend.”  



Gray also mentioned that Square and Elavon use the network to allow their merchants to instantly transfer money from merchant accounts into their bank accounts. 



As the use cases grow, the launch of the FedNow Service will help drive real-time payments toward ubiquity. 



“We still have a little bit of work to do to get to ubiquity, which would be when every individual or financial institution in the country has access to these new payment capabilities,” said Dan Gonzalez, Vice President of Customer Relations at The Federal Reserve. “But as we get ready to launch the FedNow Service this year, we’re excited about the possibilities it’s going to bring in connecting with every financial institution. So, while there are 300 [FIs] connected to RTP today, there’s still 9,000-plus financial institutions that we need to work to get connected to an instant payment system.”  



Gonzalez likened the rollout of the FedNow Service to passengers eagerly awaiting to board a plane.  



“We’re in the process of queuing everybody up and boarding participants onto the airplane,” he said. “We’ve got a number of service providers, and a number of financial institutions that are currently in the testing process. They’re exchanging messages through our network in a test format to get ready to go. We’re going to continue that for the next few months to get folks ready. 



“Once we have that airplane boarded, we’ll close that door for those first organizations, take them out onto the runway, get them taxied up and then ultimately launch that airplane later this summer. We’re excited about what’s coming and ultimately creating that path for a seamless experience to get more financial institutions connected to the network.”  



Gaming apps use real-time payments to enable money movement into and out of the apps. Although many real-time use cases are at the consumer level, soon the business-to-business (B2B) ecosystem will be benefitting from this capability.  



“The awareness factor has really leapfrogged over the past several years,” said Steve Murphy, Director of Commercial Payments at Javelin Strategy & Research. 



“If you went back to 2018 and I said to my kids, ‘I’m going to Zelle you some money for Christmas,’ they would have said, ‘What’s a Zelle?’ 



“And now that’s really at the tip of the tongue. Everybody knows that brand name.  I think that’s moving rapidly into the B2B space as well.”  



The Beneficiaries of Instant Payments 



Instant payments are about more than just moving money quickly, and it’s not just financial institutions that stand to benefit. Consumers are top of mind when it comes to real-time payment use cases. It’s about getting the money they need, right away.  



“The initial benefits we’re seeing are for consumers because consumers don’t have the big lines of credit that businesses do,” said Ruhe of Fiserv. “So cash flow is super important, especially for getting paid. That’s why you see a lot of real-time use cases not just for person-to-person payments but claim payouts and gig economy payments because getting paid is really important.”  



“Consumers will benefit by having better visibility into their account balances and a greater understanding of when funds are available and usable to them,” said The Federal Reserve’s Gonzalez.  



The next strategy for increasing use cases will be serving small businesses. “As we talk to financial institutions, they’re developing roadmaps for capabilities for all their customers, for consumers, and businesses and small businesses, said Ruhe. 



“But I predict one of the next big focus areas will be on small businesses. Small businesses also have to have a careful eye on cash flow. Real-time payments definitely help with cash flow. We’re seeing a big push to help small businesses with that cash flow by enabling more real-time payments capabilities for them.”  



“Businesses will benefit by having better control over their funds, understanding or having the ability to pay invoices in real time, taking advantage of payment discounts, and having various opportunities to manage those funds in real time with greater visibility,” added Gonzalez.  



In a digital world, The Clearing House’s Gray noted, payments need to be faster, cheaper, and easier. 



“Another thing we hear from the banks on the network is that there’s a huge value in being able to get paid faster or pay faster,” Gray said. “The immediacy is a big deal. We call it RTP for a reason. If I owe a million bucks, I can wait until midnight tonight, I can hold it in my account to 11:59, and then I can send it. And especially in a rising-interest-rate type of an economy, that’s a thing that becomes a huge deal as well.”  



Said Ruhe, “It’s not just about real time. The money gets there instantly. There are two other important features. One is it’s guaranteed, it’s confirmed. If you hit send and you get the confirmation, you know it’s there. 



“But just as important is it’s 24×7 now. That’s not in the name. We don’t call it 24×7 payments. We call it real-time payments. We as consumers operate 24×7. If I have to wait till Monday for the payment to get there because I’m trying to send money on a Friday evening, that’s a problem. 



“Our digital world operates 24×7, and the legacy payment systems do not. These new real-time payment rails do. These payments work evenings and weekends, which is important.”  



Leveraging Multiple Real-Time Networks 



To determine whether leveraging multiple real-time payment networks is possible, we must unpack the current capabilities of each platform and its role.  



“There are going to be two live real-time payment networks,” Gray said. “Both networks speak the same language, both are built on the same platform, ISO 20022. 



“I believe there will be some level of ubiquity across both networks. The networks will be able to talk to each other in some form. That’s the intent, anyway. The Fed is going live with the FedNow Service this year, and I’m sure we at The Clearing House will pick up those discussions down the road.  I don’t think it’ll ever work exactly like ACH does because of the nature of the networks. 



“ACH works in a batch process. We send files back and forth to the Fed. It’s a very straightforward process. And a bank just connects to one ACH network.” 



“With real-time payments, each transaction is processed individually within seconds. There is no concept of a batch. To get full ubiquity across the industry, you’re going to need to be connected to both networks, and you will need some type of routing capability like the Fiserv payment hub solution, as an example.”  



On that road to coveted ubiquity, financial institutions must first analyze their own goals.  



“Having ubiquity is going to be key, but there will be different ways for that to be facilitated,” The Federal Reserve’s Gonzalez said. “If one endpoint is on one network, that transaction would go to that rail. If it was on another, it would go to a different rail. I think it’s really going to be up to the financial institutions to look at their needs and see how those can be fulfilled by either network. A lot of that will be driven by the complexity of the organization, what their objectives are with real-time payments.”  



“There’s going to be a certain amount of overlap, but there won’t be 100% replication,” Mercator’s Murphy said. “Depending upon who the banks are trying to get to on the endpoints, they have to consider both networks.”  



The FI View on Sending Real-Time Payments 



Although a growing number of FIs can receive real-time payments, sending them requires additional capabilities.  



“Many FIs have started with enabling receipt of payments,” said Ruhe of Fiserv. “That doesn’t require any change to their user experience. They can just start getting payments and letting customers get paid faster.  



“Once they move to originating real-time payments, they must present some new capabilities to the user. They must change something they already do. If they have a digital payouts capability, they’re going to make changes to the service that they offer the customer for digital payouts. 



“If they are offering real-time transfers, they have to update the real-time transfers application, and that’s what their road maps really are taking into account. ‘How do I enable more of these send capabilities, a real-time bill payment capability, a real-time payables capability’? 



“Part of this is just working through the project backlog of making the changes to those applications to enable real-time. Because a real-time payment is not just a new standalone thing. A real-time payment is a new feature of a service you probably already offer.”  



The ability to both send and receive a real-time payment will quickly become a baseline expectation of a financial institution, Gonzalez noted, although send capabilities will be more challenging to acquire. 



“As these networks continue to grow and develop, and as we launch the FedNow Service later this year, the receiving capability is really going to be table stakes,” he said.  



“It is more challenging to implement the sending capabilities because of the interfaces and updates that need to be made. However, a lot of the technology providers and service providers are starting to ramp up their capabilities to send and make it easier for financial institutions to implement the send capability.  



“As we evolve and continue to grow the network, the process will become more streamlined and easier for those downstream financial institutions to be able to send for their customers.”  



Murphy offered a history lesson on how real-time capabilities have evolved. 



“Mercator did some research back in middle to late 2018 after The Clearing House RTP Network launched,” said Murphy. “We talked to eight of the larger financial institutions that were doing direct connects. 



“We asked about the challenges and how they were implementing. Most were doing receive first. A couple of them are doing receive and send simultaneously. When we asked them about the challenges from a technology standpoint, they were rating it about 5 to 6 out of 10. The larger concern was internal communications, the operational procedures that had to be in place to support sending. This is something that most of the institutions now will be looking at.”  



“A receive is a very easy pass for most FIs because technology providers like Fiserv can turn that on for you very easily,” The Clearing House’s Gray said. “Phase One has always been that we want to enable our customers to get paid faster. It’s a service they want, it’s a service they expect, and it creates a new deposit channel into the bank.  



“Now, it’s technology providers that most banks leverage. The vast majority of banks rely on a technology provider for their real-time payment-based connectivity and services. Each of those technology providers offered receive first. 



“Now they’ve all moved into or are moving into different send-based applications. Send is different than receive in that there are many use cases that are spend-based use cases where receive is one capability. You can’t just flip a switch and ‘turn on send’ because it could be a small business app, it could be a Treasury app, it could be a consumer app. 



“We see new use cases coming on board every day and most are being driven by a technology provider working with their banking relationship. It’s a technology provider that is providing a bank a service or an application they can turn on.”  



A Look Into The Future Of Real-Time Payments 



With many U.S. banks working toward providing real-time payments for customers and businesses, the innovation does not end here. New capabilities and solutions are in the works.  



Gonzalez of The Federal Reserve sees strong potential for merchant-focused offerings. 



“One large technology provider just made an announcement that its created a new platform to enable pay-by-bank for merchants,” Gonzalez said. “I do think the use of an instant payment or real-time payment network to facilitate  point-of-sale and other merchant transactions will come around. There’s been a lot of discussion in the industry about that capability as an alternative to some of the traditional payment methods. Pay-by-bank is one that I think is interesting and certainly worth the industry keeping an eye on.”  



Ruhe of Fiserv agrees and anticipates a focus on small businesses as well, adding, “A lot of the focus has been on consumers so far. At some point, the ability to use this in a merchant payment scenario will be coming. I think cross-border will be coming.  Small businesses have these same cash flow issues. They operate 24×7, and they’ve been largely underserved. Giving them the ability to pay and get paid instantly more often is going to be a big focus area of our industry in the next year.”  



Murphy of Mercator sees a strong use case in cross-border payments, “One of the things I’m hearing about is the potential for use for real time cross-border. There’s a lot of activity going on with the RTP Network, EBA clearing, and SWIFT. You might start seeing some of that during the latter portion of this year.”  



The Clearing House’s Gray outlines the broad benefits of real-time payments data, “Another thing we’re seeing is applications being developed that leverage the data capabilities of a real RTP Network payment, the ability to send information across the network as well as the actual payment. A corporate biller can send a request for payment that includes not only the request but the data associated with it (the invoice and the bill and where I want you to pay me). And that gets delivered to a small business or a consumer who can then make the decision to pay it now or pay it later.”   



What Fiserv Is Doing to Get FIs and Their Customers Connected to These Networks 



FIs do not have to worry about the complexities of processing real-time payments. With Fiserv solutions, they can easily get connected to real-time networks. 



“We’re creating solutions that are very much turnkey solutions,” Ruhe said. “Solutions that you can consume as a service or as an infrastructure.

ID Theft and Fraud: Difficult to Detect, Difficult to Monitor



Child identity fraud often goes unnoticed for years. It only makes itself known when the affected child eventually applies for a job or a student loan. Or the child attempts to file taxes for the first time, said Kitten.



“It’s also very difficult to monitor,” added Kitten. “Unless you as a parent are sharing an account with your child, you wouldn’t be clued in to who they are interacting with online.”



Halpert noted that more education for parents to help their kids be tech-savvy and safe online is needed.



“You teach your children not to walk away with someone they don’t know at the mall; but they are communicating with all these strangers who are sitting behind a screen,” Halpert said. “Parents need to be more aware of what their child is doing online.”

Social Media: Fraudsters Target Kids



This is especially true on social media, which is where fraudsters often target kids. Children are more willing to give up personal information online. And they are generally much more open and talkative on social media than adults. That means fraudsters can obtain personally identifiable information (PII) from a child to commit fraud. Javelin strongly encourages parents to not allow their children to have personal profiles on social media. They should wait until at least the age of 8. And they should limit their children’s access to social media until at least age of 6. When children do engage on social media platforms such as YouTube or Messenger Kids, they should be doing so on an account that is linked to a parent or guardian, and even then, the risks are great.



Criminals target children on social media because of how quickly they can multiply their attacks.



“If a criminal can take over the social media account of a child that has 1,000 connections, they can spread fraud to all those people (to which the child is connected),” Halpert said.



It’s important for parents to be aware of the potential signs of fraud. And they need to be proactive in dealing with them, Kitten added.



“For example, if a password to an email account suddenly doesn’t work, it may be something to look in to,” she said. “Don’t assume the child just forgot the password; it could have been taken over and changed.”



Working With Law Enforcement



In years past, parents may have been reluctant to contact law enforcement after a child identity fraud incident, or may not have known whom to contact. Luckily, that is changing. Javelin notes that engagement with law enforcement related to child identity theft and subsequent fraud has seen a healthy increase in the past year, suggesting that consumers are more readily engaging with law enforcement.



Agent McCain advises parents whose children may be victims to first contact local and state authorities; then, depending on the severity of the fraud, the case could eventually be kicked up to federal authorities.



ID Theft and Fraud: Burden on the Whole Family



Child identity fraud often creates a burden on the whole family. Kitten notes that the number of hours required by families to resolve a case of child identity fraud is 16. And that doesn’t even take into account the emotional impact.



The anonymous parent said that their family only found out about the fraud when their daughter tried to file taxes for the first time.



“It’s still not resolved, and the real issue is that someone out there has all of her information, which they could do something with at any time,” the parent said.

Javelin recommends that all parents enroll in a full family identity protection and monitoring service. They should look especially at one that also monitors social media accounts.



That’s something the parent did after the fraud was discovered, and she urged others to do so before fraud strikes.



“I would tell others, proactively enroll in an identity monitoring service,” the parent said.



Help from Financial Institutions and Credit Bureaus



Financial institutions and credit bureaus can both play key roles in helping reduce child identity fraud. Halpert noted that while an adult can quickly go online and freeze their credit in a few easy steps, doing so for a minor is actually an onerous, paper-based, and time-consuming process. He urged credit bureaus to enable parents to be able to freeze their child’s credit quickly and digitally.



“Credit bureaus need to help us on this,” Halpert said.



Financial institutions can also play a key role by providing education around child identity theft risks. Banks and credit unions can also stand out and gain a competitive advantage if they provide these services, Javelin noted.



Financial institutions should also encourage their customers to sign up for text and email alerts that warn of any suspicious activity.



“This is a basic alert function that financial institutions need to do better jobs of encouraging their customers and members to take advantage of, and institutions also need to ensure they are promoting the ability to sign up for these alerts so consumers can easily and readily employ them,” the Javelin report noted.

As a payment
system that universally connects all U.S. bank accounts, the ACH Network
supports a tremendous amount of transactions. Between Same Day ACH and core ACH
payments, the transaction volume on the ACH rails has been steadily rising. 



To learn more
about the ACH Network’s growth, and to better understand the difference between
faster payments, real-time payments, and Same Day ACH, PaymentsJournal sat down
with Michael Herd, senior vice president of ACH Network Administration at
Nacha.



Joining us in
the conversation was Sarah Grotta, director of the Debit and Alternative
Products Advisory Service at Mercator Advisory Group.

Defining the difference between payment
types



Before delving
into the growth of the ACH Network, Herd and Grotta began by explaining the
differences between faster payments, real-time payments, and Same Day ACH. Too
often, the media and public use these terms interchangeably, leading to confusion.



“Same Day ACH
is the easiest to define and understand because it is an ACH payment that
settles on the same day that it is initiated,” began Herd. In contrast, the
typical ACH payment—sometimes referred to as core ACH—would settle on the next
day or even two days after being initiated.



Defining faster
payments proves to be a little harder because it’s a general term that can
encompass a lot of different payment types. Herd described how faster payments
can be understood in three ways. First, and in the broadest sense, “faster
payments can be anything that’s faster than a paper check,” he explained.



Second, faster
payments can refer to a method that has accelerated processing in an existing
payment system. A prime example of this is Same Day ACH because it is processed
quicker than its traditional counterpart.



Finally, faster
payments could refer to an entirely new payment type that did not exist a few
years ago. For example, Zelle would be fit this definition, as would Same Day
ACH.



Herd described
that because of these differing definitions, faster payments “can be a term
that means different things in different contexts, and this can be confusing.”



Real-time
payments can also be confusing because it can refer to two different things.
One is the payment rail run by The Clearing House, known as the RTP network
(for Real-Time Payments). This is distinct from the generic term that refers to
any rail that moves in or near real time. To tell them apart, The Clearing
House’s Real-Time Payment is capitalized since it is the actual trade name of the
product, whereas the other is lowercase.



The growth of ACH



With the terms
now defined, Herd and Grotta discussed the volume growth of the ACH Network.
Put simply, the ACH Network is doing phenomenally well. 



In the third
quarter of 2019, the ACH Network volume reached 6.2 billion payments, growing
9.5% from the same quarter the year before.



 “We’re in record territory for growth on the
ACH Network,” said Herd. 



<img fetchpriority=""high"" decoding=""async"" width=""600"" height=""778"" src=""https://b2161880.smushcdn.com/2161880/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/q3-Volume.png?lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-82945"" srcset=""https://b2161880.smushcdn.com/2161880/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/q3-Volume.png?lossy=1&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 600w, https://b2161880.smushcdn.com/2161880/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/q3-Volume-231x300.png?lossy=1&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 231w"" sizes=""(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"" />


These numbers
include both Same Day ACH and core ACH transactions. But when you break it out
and look just at Same Day ACH, the numbers are even more impressive.



“Growth for
Same Day ACH is up over 50% on a year-over-year basis,” Herd said. Part of this
tremendous growth can be explained by how new the payment method is, having
just become available in September 2016. Even with this growth, Herd noted that
Same Day ACH amounts to about 1% of overall ACH Network volume.



“We’re still on
the very early end of the adoption curve for Same-Day ACH,” he said. 



The causes of ACH growth



Strikingly, ACH
payments is experiencing growth across a variety of use cases. Herd said this
was indicative of where the overall marketplace is moving, as paper check use
is declining in both consumer-oriented use cases and B2B transactions. 



Grotta said the
growth across all the various channels shows that different organizations are
finding utility for many different use cases.



Herd agreed,
highlighting one particularly interesting use case involving charitable
organizations. Organizations that frequently receive recurring donations, including
charities, nonprofits and religious institutions, are increasingly turning to
the ACH Network to receive the transactions.



How the FedNow announcement will impact
ACH



Herd noted that
since FedNow will not be rolled out for up to five years, it’s hard to forecast
how ACH volume will be impacted in the future.



“I think one of
the big unknowns collectively for the industry is what else [could] be
different four to five years from now that [could] affect the ecosystem and the
payments industry,” he said.



Grotta agreed,
noting that it will be fascinating to see how everything will unfold. She
speculated that the FedNow announcement could actually prove beneficial for the
ACH Network, at least in the short term.



Her reasoning
is that since the FedNow solution won’t be available for a few years,
businesses might explore Same Day ACH 



In addition to
discussing how FedNow might impact ACH volume, both Grotta and Herd spoke about
interoperability between the faster payment rails.



Grotta said
that the question of interoperability is one that Mercator Advisory Group will
be focusing on in the coming years. Herd noted that there exists a template for
how to implement interoperability: the ACH Network.



“We almost
forget when we call it the ACH Network, singular, that it’s actually two
interoperable networks,” Herd said. Since it’s completely seamless to end
users, they don’t realize it’s actually two networks, operated by The Clearing
House and the Federal Reserve. 



The Network
works so well because there’s a defined governance model, consisting of
business rules, formatting standards, definitions of liability, warranties and
the responsibilities of all the parties. These are known as the Nacha Operating
Rules, a topic PaymentsJournal has covered
before in an earlier conversation with Herd. 



The upcoming improvements to the ACH
Network



Herd described
a number of recent and upcoming improvements that will enhance the ACH Network.



In September
2019, Nacha implemented a faster funds availability standard. The next
improvement will come in March 2020 when the transaction dollar limit for Same
Day ACH will be increased fourfold to $100,000. 



Herd explained
that this is one of the biggest requests from corporates, so Nacha is excited
for the change to take effect. 



“It certainly
expands the realm of use cases and transaction volume that will become eligible
for Same Day ACH, particularly within the B2B space,” he said.



Another
forthcoming change is extended hours for Same Day ACH, which is planned for
March 2021. The change will add an additional two hours to the window in which Same
Day ACH payments can be initiated. Such a change will prove especially
beneficial to businesses on the West Coast due to the time zone. However, Herd
said it is important to note that the change is contingent on the Federal
Reserve approving a request to extend its settlement service hours.



If the request
is granted then the National Settlement Service (NSS) would stay open one hour
later until 6:30 p.m. ET, which in turn means Fedwire would keep running
another 30 minutes until 7 p.m. ET. It wouldn’t be the first change in hours.
The Fed extended the NSS closing time by 30 minutes to support Same Day ACH
back in 2016.



By continuing
to improve upon the ACH Network, Nacha is ensuring that an already popular
payment rail will stay competitive and useful in the shifting payments
landscape.

For most young shoppers electronic payments are already ingrained. The Payments Council is predicting that the majority of consumer purchases in the UK will be cashless this year, largely driven by millennial consumers who are less reliant on physical tender. Happily, cashless acceptance amongst more senior consumers is also growing with 19% of over-50s using contactless technology up to three times a week[viii]. Taking the capital as an example, contactless technology has successfully been rolled out by Transport for London (TfL). In July 2014 it announced that its buses would no longer accept cash as a form of payment due to the dwindling numbers of passengers using physical money to travel. This is surely justified when you consider that around 99% of passengers use Oyster, prepaid tickets, contactless payment cards or concessionary tickets instead[ix]. The benefits of a cashless society are many and wide-ranging and this data suggests we are on the right track. It will take some time to achieve, however, as commitment from consumers, merchants and banks is required for it to become a reality. Many have realised that cards and digital payments are safer and more secure but the UK isn’t ready to say goodbye to cash yet. Payment methods come to the market to increase options and are not easily shown the door. [i] Finextra, May 2015 [ii] Yahoo! Finance, June 2014 [iii] The Independent, May 2015 [iv] Fresh Business Thinking, June 2015 [v] Psychology Today, July 2012 [vi] The Guardian, June 2013 [vii] TIME, May 2012 [viii] Business Reporter, November 2015 [ix] The Guardian, July 2014 Tags: Banking ChannelsCashCustomer RetentionSelf Service and Convenience","The UK passed a major milestone on its journey to becoming a cashless society last year when it was reported that electronic payments overtook their paper counterparts for the first time[i]. According to the Payments Council, only 48% of payments made by British consumers and businesses in 2014 were in cash, down from 52% in 2013. On top of this, a separate survey found that 71% of British customers carry less than £20 in cash at any time, with half saying that they will walk no further than 100 metres to find a cash machine[ii].



So what’s causing this shift in payment habits and how would cashless benefit banks, merchants and consumers?



Danger, danger!



Firstly, cash presents greater risks than card and other forms of electronic payment. For example, keeping cash on the premises puts banks and merchants at risk of theft. We can learn from Sweden here – as one of the first countries looking set to become a cashless society – when in 2013 a bank robber left empty handed after he discovered the branch kept no cash on site[iii]. Separately, paper money is also propping up the shadow economy and costing us all due to the anonymity it provides for elicit transactions.



Time is money



It is time consuming and costly for merchants to handle cash. According to PayPal, counting notes and depositing cash at the bank is costing Britain’s small businesses around two weeks and £2.5 billion per yearii. Conversely, card payments are quick and simple, and with contactless going mainstream, retailers can serve queues of customers with even greater speed and convenience. In fact, in June 2015, the British Bankers’ Association reported that since the introduction of contactless cards, consumers have collectively saved over 90 years of waiting time at the checkout[iv].



Cash is ‘harder to spend’



Not only is cash inconvenient, it is emotive too. Research suggests that consumers spend more using their cards. Psychologists call this reluctance to part with cash ‘coupling’ – when a consumer becomes attached to cash and is less willing to part with it[v].



Cards are personal



Whether using loyalty, debit or credit cards, consumers hand over valuable data to retailers on a daily basis. Merchants can not only use this information to measure the effectiveness of promotions and monitor customer loyalty, but also target consumers with more specific and personal adverts based on their shopping habits[vi], benefitting both sides of the transaction.



Electronic equality



In a piece for Foreign Policy, Vishnu Sridharan of the New America Foundation wrote that that cash-based economies “harm the poor by heightening the risks they face when carrying money and fuelling government corruption and inefficiency”[vii]. While government corruption is (hopefully) a thing of the past for the UK, the sentiment of the statement still rings true. For many individuals with a poor credit history, for example, cash has historically been the only option as they were side-lined by the traditional banking system. Without banking services it is harder to find a stable financial footing and almost impossible to collect enough for long term investments like education and property. Times have changed though. Prepaid cards with bank-like online services are an option for those who can’t have or don’t want a traditional account. These services are increasing financial access and improving transparency in the financial services industry.



Is cashless a reality?



For most young shoppers electronic payments are already ingrained. The Payments Council is predicting that the majority of consumer purchases in the UK will be cashless this year, largely driven by millennial consumers who are less reliant on physical tender. Happily, cashless acceptance amongst more senior consumers is also growing with 19% of over-50s using contactless technology up to three times a week[viii].



Taking the capital as an example, contactless technology has successfully been rolled out by Transport for London (TfL). In July 2014 it announced that its buses would no longer accept cash as a form of payment due to the dwindling numbers of passengers using physical money to travel. This is surely justified when you consider that around 99% of passengers use Oyster, prepaid tickets, contactless payment cards or concessionary tickets instead[ix].



The benefits of a cashless society are many and wide-ranging and this data suggests we are on the right track. It will take some time to achieve, however, as commitment from consumers, merchants and banks is required for it to become a reality. Many have realised that cards and digital payments are safer and more secure but the UK isn’t ready to say goodbye to cash yet. Payment methods come to the market to increase options and are not easily shown the door.

Last week, builder and researcher John Wang wrote a guest post for Bankless titled Layer 2 Tokens Are Coming. It’s an incredible article, as it comprehensively makes the case for why and how L2 projects will embrace native token rollouts for the purposes of decentralization going forward. Notably, in the piece, Wang also speculated on a general timeline outlining when the “Big Four” rollups projects might launch their own tokens. Toward that end, he forecasted: “I believe rollup tokens will arrive late 2022 and sometime in 2023 in the following order: zkSync ( confirmed ) -> StarkNet ( no comment ) -> Arbitrum -> ( no comment ) -> Optimism ( public denial) .” I’m certainly not an L2 expert of the caliber Wang is. But I’ve spent a lot of time looking at the L2 ecosystem, and from everything I’ve seen so far, his forecasts here seem totally reasonable and on the mark. With all that said, I think a great way to make the most of L222 and ready yourself for L2 token season is to follow Wang’s blueprints and get involved with the Big Four rollups as a user in the here and now, such as: Transacting on these L2s Using their apps Using bridges Building new L2 apps However, since most of us aren’t developers and app development is out of the cards for us, focusing on the first three points — transacting and using apps and bridges — is perfectly fine and a straightforward means of approach.

In order to fully decentralize and compete with alt-L1s, networks like zkSync, Optimism, Arbitrum, and StarkWare will need to launch native tokens.Naturally, the question is “wen token?!”John predicted that these rollups will begin distributing tokens in late 2022 and into 2023.Why? Because L2s still have a number of technical hurdles before deploying tokens to govern their networks.That gives us, according to John’s predictions, almost a full year to play around on various rollups and accumulate whatever eligibility criteria each rollup team will use to distribute native tokens.To William, this criteria will largely come in the form of:TransactionsBridge usageApp usageLet’s get started!- RSAMany of Ethereum’s most promising layer 2 (L2) scaling solutions will launch native tokens over the next couple of years.

Over the past two years, I’ve seen a growing number of cryptoartists explore delegating this work to enterprising experts, much like how music promoters get the word out for musicians. I think as cryptoartists become that much more popular and the scene becomes further saturated, we’ll see more cryptoart promoters offering their services. 2) DAO designer NFT projects often revolve around communities. And DAOs (for decentralized autonomous organizations) can help communities coordinate effectively in decentralized fashion. So I expect to see many more NFT-related DAOs going forward. However, setting up a DAO soundly can be daunting and difficult for NFTers who aren’t well-versed in DAOs, so I think DAO design consultants are going to prove increasingly popular in the coming years. 3) Metaversal architect The number of NFT-based virtual world projects is blossoming fast. This will lead to growing demand for virtual architects like Devil.eth, who has become renowned in Ethereum’s side of the metaverse for their intricate commissioned builds on Cryptovoxels. 4) Metaversal videographer Speaking of Ethereum’s side of the metaverse, here we’ll soon start seeing more live events, sports, commercials, documentaries, you name it. In kind, there’s going to be more people wanting to record and document the metaverse’s happenings, so expect to see more metaversal videographer’s like Paradoxx.eth entering the ecosystem. 5) Token economist NFT projects will increasingly lean on tokenomics experts to effectively design new token releases. Remember how leading NFT game Axie Infinity hired Delphi Digital’s consulting division to design the AXS token? Expect projects small and large to look for similar types of assistance going forward.","Dear Bankless Nation,When it comes to the NFT ecosystem, there are many professional opportunities beyond just minting or trading NFTs.Indeed, the crossroads between Web3 and the metaverse is currently blooming with cultural and economic activity in all directions, and this is leading to growing demand for a range of new sorts of NFT specialists.Below, I’ve compiled a list of 8 such NFT-centric specialist gigs that may be relatively under the radar now, but that I expect will become much more commonplace going forward.Any suit your fancy?

Much harder, though, is engineering an NFT drop that balances the needs of collectors while avoiding certain common pitfalls. As such, NFT drop specialists are here to stay.7) NFT appraiserValuing a non-floor NFT properly can be a complex task. And while I’ve seen some NFT appraisal projects so far, I get the impression the sector is still really early on. I think there will be plenty of room going forward for expert appraisers and specialist appraisal collectives, so NFT appraisal and analysis chops will prove increasingly useful.8) NFT writerI’ve seen incredible demand for professional writers all around the NFT ecosystem, but lately the demand is far exceeding what the Web3 labor pool can currently supply. So if you know your way around NFTs and can competently write an article, just realize that many places would love to have you right now.

Where does crypto fit in?,,"Dear Bankless Nation, We’re now into our 5th day of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Here’s my tl;dr: of the conflict: Ukrainian forces have been surprisingly effective. Morale is reportedly high, and Russia has been unable to secure any major victory in the country. Many Russian forces seem confused and bewildered as to why they are in Ukraine at all. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has emerged as a hero , instilling confidence in Ukrainian forces. Nevertheless, the sheer magnitude of Russian forces has been able to surround the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. Concerns about the Ukrainian forces’ ability to maintain the fight are unabated. See this tweet thread on the first 96 hours of the war for a more comprehensive update. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has far-reaching implications for crypto which will become obvious in the weeks and months ahead. And for the first time in a while, governments across the world are on the same page about something: they all plan to financially sanction Russia. The Sanctioning of Russia Sanctions from around the world are coming in FAST. The USA, UK, EU, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan each hit Moscow with economic sanctions. Notably, Taiwan has banned all semiconductor shipments to Russia. While this doesn’t immediately impact Russia today , no country can last long without semiconductors. Computer chips are in everything and >90% of them are produced by Taiwan. Russia gets SWIFTed The US, UK, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, and the European Commission have also collectively agreed to expel Russian banks from the SWIFT payments network, in an “unprecedented act of global sanctions coordination” This means that the target Russian banks have almost no ability to send or receive money outside of Russia, rendering them nearly useless as financial institutions. Central Bank Assets Frozen Perhaps most painfully, the EU and US coalition has also imposed sanctions on the Russian Central Bank paralyzing over $640 billion in Russia’s foreign currencies. As of now, no US persons or companies can engage with the central bank of Russia. Russia’s billions in central banks reserves are only useful to Putin if the money can actually be used, and with frozen accounts, Putin can no longer access this money.","Dear Bankless Nation,We’re now into our 5th day of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.Here’s my tl;dr: of the conflict:Ukrainian forces have been surprisingly effective.

Going from 80 Rubles per $1 to almost 120 Rubles per $1, marking the largest single-day declines in the value of Moscow’s currency ever recorded.Russian citizens both inside and outside of Russia have been waiting in hour-long queues to withdraw their cash from Russian bank accounts.The devaluation of the Ruble has stoked fears of hyperinflation. To fight this, the Russian central bank more than doubled interest rates to 20% today.Even the Moscow stock exchange decided not to open today. If it had, I’d expect to see a bloodbath in the devaluation of Russian companies too.Russia’s financial world is effectively “closed”.What about crypto?There are two parts of how crypto is relevant:How crypto is helping right nowThe crypto will impact future economic sanctions in the futureCrypto Is Helping UkrainiansUkraine DAOUkraine DAO has been spun up with the help from Pussy Riot’s Nadya Tolokonnikova which has raised nearly $4 million for Ukraine.You can join the Party Bid to purchase a JPEG of the Ukrainian flag here.Self-CustodyYou can hold crypto by memorizing 12 words or discretely keeping a hardware wallet in your pocket.Sometimes, being able to hold your savings in the palm of your hand is the form factor needed to enable you to keep it during times of war.Russian citizens’ flight to Bitcoin?BTC volume on Russian exchanges jump to ATHs as Russian citizens flee the Ruble.Crypto is here for the people.Whether it’s a Ukrainian fleeing from war or a Russian protecting their savings, the self-custody of non-sovereign money enables people to protect the value of their wealth from the decisions of misaligned political leaders.Fiat currencies devalue when governments make poor choices.Maybe this is why Bitcoin surpassed the Ruble today in market cap:The CliffhangerOnce the Ukraine conflict is over, I expect the conversation of global economic sanctions and cryptocurrency to take center stage.So here’s where we are now:These conversations are just getting started; we’ll need to wait and see how they develop.One thing is likely certain: anti-crypto government leaders will likely use this as an example as to why “crypto is bad” and why draconian crypto regulation is justified.My heart goes out to the Ukrainian families who have to endure the invasion and destruction of their homeland.It also pains me to see Russian soldiers who clearly have no interest in being there either.I take some solace in that I see the entire world all being on the same page for once about something:F*ck Vladimir Putin.- David",https://www.bankless.com/weaponized-banks,2022-02-28T00:00:00.000Z,"https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/image/fetch/w_1200,h_600,c_limit,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https-3a-2f-2fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com-2fpublic-2fimages-2fba85cb09-7c81-4f36-ae7d-22e8dbb0af79_1288x902.jpg",David Hoffman,Bankless,blog,Unknown Error,

A 2022 Game Developers Conference report surveying over 2,700 game developers finds that “a majority of game industry professionals said their companies were not interested at all in cryptocurrency (72%) or NFTs (70%)”.Why do gamers hate NFTs?The key objection seems to stem from monetization concerns, revolving around the play-to-earn model that was popularized by Axie Infinity in mid-2021.Unlike traditional games where the in-game money supply and items are subject to the control of developers, blockchain games allow players to create, fully own, and exchange their assets freely between the worlds of crypto and fiat on their own terms. This transition from a socialist “you trade what we say you can trade” to a capitalist “everything is freely tradable” gaming economy opens an opportunity for players to reap a profit for their invested time and effort - hence “play-to-earn”.Seen in this context, it’s understandable why gamers are skeptical of NFTs. Games are a sweet escape from the monotony and stresses of life. Market forces disrupt this meticulously designed simulation, blurring the lines that separate gamers from their fantasy worlds.All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy, and Jack demands his playtime.There is perhaps also an unspoken sense of fairness in gaming that gamers feel are being violated. Games let players craft their destinies from a palette of roleplaying possibilities – under the condition that we all start from an equal footing. But, a blockchain economy where players can purchase resources with fiat (like an Axie player acquires SLP) may permit them to progress in-game without climbing the traditional merit-based ladder.This sentimental premise of merit-based progress is what drives many veteran gamers’ disdain for pay-to-win microtransaction-type purchases like loot boxes that are rampant on casual “freemium” mobile games. They tolerate it if the purchases offer aesthetic upgrades but the discontent grows if players can buy tangible gameplay advantages.In short, blockchain gaming offers the proverbial Matrix red pill. But hardcore gamers are perfectly happy in their simulation and no, they would not like to see how deep the rabbit hole goes.Blockchains ruin gaming - for whom?Whenever the media reports on big groups of angry people, our brains have a tendency to simplify them into one homogeneous group voicing a unified set of preferences. Do the tedious work of wading through that noise, however, and a more complex reality almost always emerges.Gamers protest that the added in-game commercialization from blockchains into games will alter the art form for the worse: but worse for whom?The loudest hostility towards blockchain games tends to come from “hardcore” non-casual gamers populating Steam marketplaces and the hallowed halls of Reddit (notice how they cheered when Valve banned blockchain games).Yet, it’s not clear that this vocal fanbase is representative of the broader 3.24 billion players strong gaming market with vastly different consumer preferences.Data from a Newzoo report shows that casual mobile gamers (55%) dwarf both PC and console gamers put together (45%).Revenue figures tell the same tale. Mobile gaming revenues make up more than half (52%) of the industry, as opposed to 20% on PC games and 28% from console gaming.But of course, microtransactions populate both casual and non-casual gaming. Different reports find that the revenue share generated from microtransactions alone ranged from the lower end of $34.5 billion in 2021 to the higher estimate of $92.6 billion in 2020.The market has spoken: casual mobile gaming reigns. If commercialization within games is bad, a significant number of gamers are quite OK with that.Yes, it’s a shocker, I know. That market of uncultured philistines, who wouldn’t know a good game from a bad, who scarcely has any appreciation for the art of video gaming, who dares indulge in “pay-to-win” microtransactions on Clash of Clans, and whom we are all very concerned now will direct their monies towards NFT gaming.Taken together, the data tells us that even if some gamers think in-game monetization is bad, the larger majority of the gaming market disagrees.Non-casual gamers complaining about blockchain games introducing unwanted financialization state a subjective preference that reflects a minority slice of the gaming market. They’re well-entitled to their preferences, of course. The beauty of free markets is that it allows a diversity of values to coexist simultaneously. But suffice to say, they don’t speak for the billions of casual gamers who are perfectly happy to shell out a few bucks for their games and will likely welcome play-to-earn opportunities.Is this speculation? On-chain data from a 2021 Dappradar report found that a significant 1.4-2.7 million unique active wallets connect to blockchain games daily. In Q3 2021 alone, gaming NFTs generated 22% ($2.32 billion) of all NFT sales. Another estimate finds that the blockchain gaming market in 2021 ballooned to $1.5 billion in sales (approximate three-quarters comes from Axie Infinity).The play-to-earn model is nascent, but it is already passing the market test.Play-to-earn is economic freedomHardcore gamers think of gaming as a commerce-free meritocracy where the “best” players come out on top fairly, but this is a fallacy. All games have pockets of play-to-earn elements, only we don’t think of them in monetary terms.The best players spend the most scarce resource - time - to hone their skills, grind the best gear (Diablo anybody?), and clout for their toons. In crypto, we think of whales as those with deep money pockets. In gaming, the “whales” are those with the most time on their hands. The rest of us with less time to commit to the game will simply not be highly-ranked on leaderboards, be well-geared enough to be invited to raids, or be held in high esteem by the community.Web3 extends what Web2 does for gaming. Web2 allowed (some) gamers to commercialize their time in games by Twitch live streaming, and earn prize money from tournaments and product sponsorships thanks to social media. Web3 furthers that egalitarian logic by enabling that for everyone. Does anyone remember video gaming before Web2? Bragging about my hard-earned Runescape leaderboard scores on an obscure internet board was just about all the “earnings” I  got.Even veteran gamers who are worried about play-to-earn vandalizing their virtual worlds will agree that our favorite games can involve too much tedious labor and grind. We want to get to the high levels so we get invited to the dragon-slaying raids, but can we avoid having to repetitively kill a million boars in the process like Cartman and friends in South Park?Play-to-earn will probably not completely overhaul the “grinding” process, but it can at least redesign games so players get rewarded for it. And these rewards aren’t trivial. A 2008 research paper estimates that EverQuest 2 players are “losing” $24,852 per year in opportunity costs, based on their average playing hours (25-29hours a week) and earning power of the societies they live in.The non-fungible-tokenization of third-party skins, maps, and patches also opens a lucrative door for the thousands of Skyrim, Half-Life, and Minecraft gaming modders and creators of user-generated content to distribute their creations for free while getting paid for it by their “100 true fans”.Blockchain games promise to unlock all of these earning potentials, and more. Critics of play-to-earn worry that the monetization model threatens to strip the ‘fun’ out of games but these arguments greatly miss the point. Play-to-earn empowers players with a welfare-enhancing alternative than the options currently available to them. That is much better than doing nothing.Play-to-earn is not a PonziBecause some blockchain games like Axie Infinity require players to make an upfront investment of $100-300, critics have hastily jumped to “Ponzinomics” conclusions.First, not all games are built with a high entry barrier. Plenty of popular free-to-play blockchain games like Splinterlands and Gods Unchained already exist. This is true too for upcoming big-budget AAA titles. Aurory, an upcoming roleplaying game on Solana, allows players to play for free and earn NFTs (called Nefty/Nefties) and in-game currency (AURY) in the process. Illuvium, another much-hyped AAA title on Ethereum plans to release its game as free-to-play, with options for players to pay and access gated content like is currently done in many freemium games. So please don’t fret that little William will be spending summer break logged into a “virtual casino”.Second, insofar as paid entry barriers remain, GameFi DAOs like Yield Guild Games or Merit Circle have emerged to democratize entry for millions of players to join a profit-sharing model. Some critics think this is exploitative, but we don’t think the same when professional eSports teams conduct the same hire-and-training for the cream of the crop.Finally, as more blockchain games enter the fray over time, economic theory tells us that the higher supply will cause Axie’s pay-to-play model to fall out of favor. Games that cannot compete on play-to-earn profit returns to players will begin appealing to players through other traditional gameplay elements like immersion and creativity (gamers rejoice!). Striking this hybrid balance between leisure and play-to-earn will be the equilibrium of blockchain gaming.Blockchains further enable spontaneous gaming worldsThe biggest reason to be excited about blockchain games is the kinds of emergent effects that commercial culture and market mechanisms will inject into games. Emergent effects refer to the spontaneous orders and outcomes that develop from decentralized human action, or in the words of the Scottish philosopher Adam Ferguson: “the result of human action, but not the execution of any human design.”Desire paths are a common example of a spontaneous orderMany such spontaneous orders already exist within traditionally “socialist” gaming economies. The best examples are documented by the economic historian Steve Davies in the notorious sandbox MMORPG EVE Online, where whole geopolitical orders, large player factions with 30,000+ members, and complex economic systems developed without central direction.In MMORPGs like EverQuest, World of Warcraft, and LOTR Online, the popular Dragon Kill Points (DKP) legal property rights system emerged spontaneously as a way for players to fairly allocate rare loot from group raids.Even within relatively simple 2-D games such as Pac-Man or Super Mario World saw gamers craft their own unique experiences by creating ways to compete with each other through high scores. The designers of simulator games like Minecraft set loose boundaries for gameplay but they could not have imagined that journalists would leverage it to host a digital library of more than 200 censored books for activists in authoritarian societies.The Uncensored Library in MinecraftIf all this spontaneity developed without blockchain immutability, imagine how gaming will change when players can create, own and exchange freely based on actual market incentives?Just as NFTs enable social clubs, immutable property ownership in games can incentivize players to knit stronger communitarian bonds in guilds/clans to drive higher player adoption and retention. Third-party game modders and creators of user-generated content can finally reap a share of value from the gaming economies they help improve and have more incentive to create better quality mods.Even if in-game items lack direct interoperability between virtual worlds, players who choose to exit a game can retain some capital from invested time by trading their NFTs into a common cryptocurrency. This is analogous to how paper money historically freed capital mobility from a system of barter trade. The economic implications would be massive, to say the least. Like real-world economies, this would intertwine different gaming economies in novel ways that even the best developers could not anticipate.Far from impoverishing gaming culture, blockchains have the potential to socially and economically enrich the world of video gaming by opening up a world of player interaction possibilities.ConclusionWhen Blizzard bans gold farmers in World of Warcraft, they do so because the economic value is leaking from their walled gardens and hurting their profit margins. For many years, Microsoft enforced intellectual property laws that allowed Minecraft users to modify and create user-generated content, but prohibited them from selling officially licensed code for profit, effectively maintaining a gray economy of passionate fans that lived to serve them.Gamers are rightly worried about how blockchains will change their treasured worlds. But their passion for games coupled with a gross misunderstanding of blockchains has led them to end up defending the one true profit-maximizing dictatorship: Gaming publishers. Blockchains provide a way to legitimize every facet of the gaming economy and include the 99% in the process of wealth creation. Not just developers, not just Pewdiepie, but everyone. The change will come with risk, but risk is also the prerequisite for progress.Action steps🎧 Ryan Wyatt, former Head of Gaming at YouTube, on crypto and gaming📖 Read up on why Play to Earn is the future of gaming👓 Check out Donovan’s previous article on Bankless",https://www.bankless.com/why-gamers-shouldnt-hate-nfts,2022-03-02T00:00:00.000Z,"https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/image/fetch/w_1200,h_600,c_limit,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https-3a-2f-2fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com-2fpublic-2fimages-2f15a3925d-f985-425c-8c90-3e8e63f811bb_2667x1501.jpg",Ryan Sean Adams,Bankless,blog,Unknown Error,

I believe the principles of this new internet of ownership will actually make the world a better place and open doors for people who haven’t yet had a seat at the table.So, why aren’t women joining the crypto community? These are my six reasons.1. Crypto often starts as a side hustleMany people get into crypto as a hobby.If they have time, it might even turn into a side hustle - contributing a couple of hours a week to a DAO, yield-farming, or flipping NFTs. All of these side-hustles are done after-hours, in the evenings, and on the weekends.This side-hustle culture might attract more men than women because women of all generations are still largely responsible for childcare, housekeeping duties, grocery shopping, and meal prep. Married women with children dedicate nearly twice as much time to cleaning, childcare, and housework compared to their husbands.Regardless of strides made to make women more equal in the workforce, they’re missing out on equality in the overlooked but essential realms of the kitchen, the living room, the laundry room, and the grocery store.This sat strangely with me. Isn’t my generation the progressive, world-changing one? Aren’t we tossing aside those tired old gender norms? But even young couples still have this massive after-hours work imbalance in their homes. The further I researched this, the more it seemed that having a crypto side hustle just isn’t feasible for many women, especially those with children.It’s shown in the side-hustle numbers, too. 46% of employed men report having a side-hustle, compared to 35% of employed women. And men make quite a bit more on their side hustles. An average monthly side hustle paycheck for a man is $2,708, but for a woman, it’s only $526. Side-hustles aren’t just more feasible for men who don’t take the house duties. For many possible reasons, they end up being much more profitable, too.“Until Americans turn their attention to the home, where gender inequality remains deeply protected by old-school social norms, they will have an incomplete picture of the problem and incomplete solutions for addressing it,” wrote Aliya Hamid Rao for The Atlantic. In other words, if we don’t get real about what’s going on in the house, we won’t get women into Web3.Crypto could bring women into the fold. We just need to find ways to make it feasible for women to jump into crypto full-time rather than having to take it on as a side gig. By creating full-time, paid roles for individuals who are outside of crypto or have one foot in the door but haven’t fully tumbled down the rabbithole yet, we’ll create more opportunities for women to join the crypto front lines.Camilla Russo, the author of The Infinite Machine and creator of the media company The Defiant, has been one of my biggest inspirations throughout my crypto journey so far. Image source.2. Crypto is portrayed as the next generation of tech brosThe media is obsessed with one type of knowledge worker.Male. White. Twenty-something. Rumpled t-shirt going on day three. In need of a haircut. Introverted, qualifies for the Mensa Society, and socially awkward in a quirky way. Created something that made him wealthy forever and ever. If we get lucky he’ll start donating it to clean water or something.The problem isn’t that these guys exist—many of them are doing great work. The problem is that when this narrative is played over and over again, it can feel like there’s no space in it for women.This narrative becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. The “tech bro” becomes such an enduring trope that people can’t imagine life without him around, making some cool new startup that will bleed money for years before getting bought by a FAANG. They even start wearing those zip-up sweatshirts to look like a tech bro. And crypto falls right in line.SourceIf crypto is painted as the new Silicon Valley, the crypto bro is painted as the new tech bro. The crypto bro might have some similarities to the tech bro (I’m sure they both need a haircut) but the ethos is still the same.And when this narrative persists, it prevents girls and women from getting in the game. Not everyone wants to go around breaking glass ceilings and defying gender norms. It gets tiring. The media’s “tech bro turned crypto bro” narrative is creating a barrier for women getting into crypto. It’s a self-fulfilling prophecy—VCs see guys who look and talk like them, then they decide to fund them. And then more guys who look and talk like the original guys end up in the space, and it keeps spiraling.But there can be space for women in this narrative. We don’t need to build an industry by and for crypto bros. In fact, try this, stop using the word “crypto bro” right now. We can demolish the old boys club culture of tech and hire women outside of crypto who just haven’t made the leap yet. By bringing in women for full-time work who may have soft skills, such as art, communication, writing, and project management, we’ll shatter the tech bro narrative and turn it upside down.3. Crypto is for risk-takers and women aren’t encouraged to take risksStudies show that women are more risk-averse than men. And crypto, as we know from the rollercoaster-like dips and pumps (as well as some keep-you-up-at-night-worthy regulatory uncertainty) that we experience on a weekly basis, is rather risky. But do women really feel that risk-averse that they can’t hold some blue-chip tokens?“I've always felt crypto, in general, is also a male thing, since my first approach was through HODLing rather than trading,” said Ornella, a core member of BanklessDAO who contributes to International Media Nodes and Marketing. “To see women in the space was a very, very rare thing.”While it is true that women engage in fewer high-risk activities than men, including everything from skiing to climbing to freediving, I think the issue goes deeper than simple risk-aversion. One study found that even though women are underrepresented in the high-risk sports of cliff diving and freediving, the women who are in those sports don’t show any fewer instances of sensation-seeking behavior, a form of risk-taking. In other words, women in those sports are just as risk-tolerant as men. There must be other factors at play.One possible explanation is our socialization. From an early age, women are socialized not to take risks, while men are encouraged to do daring things. As a kid, I was in Girl Scouts and my brother was in Boy Scouts. While they went into the woods and threw knives at tree stumps, we Girl Scouts had a rule that we weren’t even allowed to run on pavement. We sat inside and filled in workbooks, while the boys went rock-climbing and camping for weeks. The risk-taking socialization goes even deeper. Girls watch movies and read stories about princesses stuck in castles, patiently waiting for the brave, risk-taking knight to go through all the conquests and come to save them. Many of our modern stories don’t follow this same trope, but they still draw inspiration from it.So, we know that some women may be more risk-averse than some men. But I believe that socialization and society’s expectations of women contribute to the creation of risk-aversion more than anything else.While it’s hard to change societal expectations and requirements, it’s easier to make changes at a smaller scale. Rewarding both men and women for the risks they take, and then encouraging more healthy risk-taking, is a great first step.Li Jin, Web3 thought-leader and co-founder of Variant Fund, has also been a huge inspiration to me, especially through writing. Image source.4. Crypto requires hard skills, like comp-sci and financeTwo of the primary industries that feed directly into crypto, finance and computer science, are both heavily male. According to a Preqin report on Venture Capital firms, women only make up 17.9% of the employees and 9.9% of the senior roles. And college majors in the hard sciences like physics, engineering, and computer science, still have four men to every one woman.They’re heavily male for many reasons—men were historically pushed toward math, finance, and hard sciences. Boys are socialized to experiment with science and math-brain-oriented toys, like legos, at a young age. Gender norms, such as who is the “breadwinner” in the house, are trickier to erase than we think.But crypto extends far beyond these hard skills. It’s just not well understood.In BanklessDAO all core contributors have a toolkit of soft skills at their disposal. They’re communicators, writers, thinkers, artists, and readers. They’re not solely number-crunchers or people so deep into coding that they don’t come up for air. They’re people who are so much more multi-dimensional than that.Crypto is getting more people with soft skills and from backgrounds that aren’t VC firms or Silicon Valley tech startups. Just look at the explosion of artists coming in through NFTs, or writers coming in to own their pieces via platforms like Mirror. We need to continue working actively to change the narrative of crypto as a place for only people who care about finance and computer science. It’s so much more than that.Chase Chapman hosts my favorite Web3 podcast: On the Other Side. I love that she highlights diverse voices and brings a unique, positive-sum perspective to the table. Image source.5. Crypto is for people who only talk about moneyBankless touts crypto as an incredible wealth-generating opportunity. It’s exciting and people have made a lot of money. But compared to men, women shy away from talking about money, especially about moon shots that make crypto so attractive to so many people.I’ve never talked about money with female friends. Unless we’re venmo-ing each other for dinner or complaining about paying rent, we’re not talking about money. We’re never talking about gaining money, either—we might be talking about what we wished we had, but never how we’re planning on getting it. I know many women have a similar experience, and it crosses generations. For example, I’ve never heard my mother talk about money with her friends, but I’ve often heard my father talk about stocks with his friends.Maybe part of this is because women are characterized as excessive spenders and shopaholics in the media. High school girls with “daddy’s credit card” are ostracized. Women with money and power have been accused of getting there by “sleeping their way to the top.” A woman with money is not viewed in the same way as a man with money, and our culture shows it.It’s possible that women don’t talk about money because of the way they’re treated when they do have money. It’s also possible that the old adage of men being breadwinners prevents women from talking about it.So, how do we solve this in crypto?We talk about the crypto things that are about more than money. But we also cultivate safe, healthy spaces for women to talk about money without feeling that they’re going to be criticized. We make it normal for women to talk about money, ask for raises, and climb the economic ladder. The open, free space of crypto means we can create a lot of these norms now.Simona Pop is an Ethereum thought-leader, contributor at Gitcoin and Status, and founder of Bounties Network. Simona Pop is great at offering a zoomed-out perspective on the future we’re building in crypto. She articulates these ideas in this podcast episode. Image source.6. Crypto is an anon-friendly spaceNow that I’m deeper into crypto, I know that anons aren’t anon so they can hide from their past (unless you’re Sifu). Rather, they’re anon so they can create a new identity that better fits them in this new reality we’re all building. And I support that wholeheartedly—it makes crypto better that people can be comfortable in their own skin and their new identity.But, when I was on the outside of crypto looking into this anon-dominated space, I was a little worried. Anon spaces have historically been hostile to women. Forums on anon-dominated platforms, like Reddit and FourChan are not places that women often traffic. I’m sure you’ve heard of movements like these. Anonymity is, unfortunately, one of the main tools that allow these movements to persist.When I first joined a DAO and saw the sheer number of reddit-like names and avatar profile pictures, I took a step back and thought about what I was doing. Should I be here? I wondered. I knew they were mostly male—the voices in calls tell you that—and I wondered if this would be a welcome space. But as soon as I started joining calls, I knew that this was an anon space unlike any other. This was a welcoming and kind and warm space, not cold and hostile like ones I’d read cautionary tales about before.Crypto has a marketing problem. It doesn’t know how to pull off the anon-space-vibe in a way that doesn’t feel chat-room-y and Reddit-forum-y.Would going so far as professionalizing and, essentially, KYC-ing the space mean that we’d get more women involved? Maybe, maybe not. I’ve noticed that women tend to use their “real” names and “real” pictures on Discord and Twitter more often than men. But taking away the rich culture of anonymity would mean we lose a large piece of what makes crypto what it is.I think that we just need to make it clear to more women that this anon space is not like the ones we’ve all heard about and stayed far, far away from. This is a welcoming, warm space that is inclusive to all. And, with some positive press and more and more women coming in, we can show that.How to bring more women into cryptoOnce more women join the space, it will create a positive feedback loop. Ornella observed this in BanklessDAO, saying that the growing number of women involved is “possible now since there were brave ones who stepped up at the very beginning when it was all men. They paved the way for new women to come by and get involved. That's one of the reasons why I stayed, and definitely a foundation to keep working on top of.”But how do we kickstart this positive feedback loop? We can’t change deep societal problems. Unfortunately, on a daily basis, you and I are stuck with those. But, there are a few concrete steps you and I can take to bring more women into crypto.Hire outside the circle of crypto insiders: While it’s tempting to hire someone who’s been holding their bags since ‘16, if that’s your standard, you’re going to be hiring mostly men. Many women haven’t been in crypto that long, for the reasons I described above. However, these diverse perspectives are essential for a strong company, DAO, or protocol.Post jobs that are not side hustles: Not everyone can take on a side hustle. Many need a steady 9-5 that allows them to have time for childcare and housework. Offering full-time work will open doors for new groups.Talk to all your friends and family about crypto, not just the guys who bought GME on Robinhood.

This is a welcoming, warm space that is inclusive to all. And, with some positive press and more and more women coming in, we can show that.","Dear Bankless Nation,Yesterday was International Woman’s Day.It was awesome to see my Twitter feed light up with an appreciation for all the amazing women in crypto.But at the same time, it was a grim reminder that there really aren’t that many women in the space.It’s no secret that crypto is male-dominated. In a DAO survey that BanklessDAO did with Gitcoin, just over 11% of the hundreds of participants identified as female.In a space as busy as ours, it’s easy to sweep the imbalance under the rug and say we’ll tackle it later.But doing so narrows the mission of Bankless.We can’t afford to miss 50% of the world.We cannot fully extricate our population from the legacy financial system if our wives, girlfriends, sisters, daughters, mothers, and nieces are still stuck with their bank accounts.Going Bankless is for everyone.Samantha tells us what we can do about it.- RSAShortly after joining BanklessDAO, I became the Talent Scout for the Writers Guild. I talked to hundreds of people who were interested in joining the guild. Of those, I could count the number of women on one hand.BanklessDAO is technically thousands-strong, with probably around 500 active contributors and maybe a dozen women. This is not because BanklessDAO is inhospitable to women—on the contrary. The DAO is incredibly warm and welcoming.Crypto as a whole has this problem.Our space seeks to be inclusive to everyone—and I believe it can be. I believe the principles of this new internet of ownership will actually make the world a better place and open doors for people who haven’t yet had a seat at the table.So, why aren’t women joining the crypto community? These are my six reasons.1. Crypto often starts as a side hustleMany people get into crypto as a hobby.If they have time, it might even turn into a side hustle - contributing a couple of hours a week to a DAO, yield-farming, or flipping NFTs. All of these side-hustles are done after-hours, in the evenings, and on the weekends.This side-hustle culture might attract more men than women because women of all generations are still largely responsible for childcare, housekeeping duties, grocery shopping, and meal prep. Married women with children dedicate nearly twice as much time to cleaning, childcare, and housework compared to their husbands.Regardless of strides made to make women more equal in the workforce, they’re missing out on equality in the overlooked but essential realms of the kitchen, the living room, the laundry room, and the grocery store.This sat strangely with me. Isn’t my generation the progressive, world-changing one? Aren’t we tossing aside those tired old gender norms? But even young couples still have this massive after-hours work imbalance in their homes. The further I researched this, the more it seemed that having a crypto side hustle just isn’t feasible for many women, especially those with children.It’s shown in the side-hustle numbers, too. 46% of employed men report having a side-hustle, compared to 35% of employed women. And men make quite a bit more on their side hustles. An average monthly side hustle paycheck for a man is $2,708, but for a woman, it’s only $526. Side-hustles aren’t just more feasible for men who don’t take the house duties. For many possible reasons, they end up being much more profitable, too.“Until Americans turn their attention to the home, where gender inequality remains deeply protected by old-school social norms, they will have an incomplete picture of the problem and incomplete solutions for addressing it,” wrote Aliya Hamid Rao for The Atlantic. In other words, if we don’t get real about what’s going on in the house, we won’t get women into Web3.Crypto could bring women into the fold. We just need to find ways to make it feasible for women to jump into crypto full-time rather than having to take it on as a side gig. By creating full-time, paid roles for individuals who are outside of crypto or have one foot in the door but haven’t fully tumbled down the rabbithole yet, we’ll create more opportunities for women to join the crypto front lines.Camilla Russo, the author of The Infinite Machine and creator of the media company The Defiant, has been one of my biggest inspirations throughout my crypto journey so far. Image source.2. Crypto is portrayed as the next generation of tech brosThe media is obsessed with one type of knowledge worker.Male. White. Twenty-something. Rumpled t-shirt going on day three. In need of a haircut. Introverted, qualifies for the Mensa Society, and socially awkward in a quirky way. Created something that made him wealthy forever and ever. If we get lucky he’ll start donating it to clean water or something.The problem isn’t that these guys exist—many of them are doing great work. The problem is that when this narrative is played over and over again, it can feel like there’s no space in it for women.This narrative becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. The “tech bro” becomes such an enduring trope that people can’t imagine life without him around, making some cool new startup that will bleed money for years before getting bought by a FAANG. They even start wearing those zip-up sweatshirts to look like a tech bro. And crypto falls right in line.SourceIf crypto is painted as the new Silicon Valley, the crypto bro is painted as the new tech bro. The crypto bro might have some similarities to the tech bro (I’m sure they both need a haircut) but the ethos is still the same.And when this narrative persists, it prevents girls and women from getting in the game. Not everyone wants to go around breaking glass ceilings and defying gender norms. It gets tiring. The media’s “tech bro turned crypto bro” narrative is creating a barrier for women getting into crypto. It’s a self-fulfilling prophecy—VCs see guys who look and talk like them, then they decide to fund them. And then more guys who look and talk like the original guys end up in the space, and it keeps spiraling.But there can be space for women in this narrative. We don’t need to build an industry by and for crypto bros. In fact, try this, stop using the word “crypto bro” right now. We can demolish the old boys club culture of tech and hire women outside of crypto who just haven’t made the leap yet. By bringing in women for full-time work who may have soft skills, such as art, communication, writing, and project management, we’ll shatter the tech bro narrative and turn it upside down.3. Crypto is for risk-takers and women aren’t encouraged to take risksStudies show that women are more risk-averse than men. And crypto, as we know from the rollercoaster-like dips and pumps (as well as some keep-you-up-at-night-worthy regulatory uncertainty) that we experience on a weekly basis, is rather risky. But do women really feel that risk-averse that they can’t hold some blue-chip tokens?“I've always felt crypto, in general, is also a male thing, since my first approach was through HODLing rather than trading,” said Ornella, a core member of BanklessDAO who contributes to International Media Nodes and Marketing. “To see women in the space was a very, very rare thing.”While it is true that women engage in fewer high-risk activities than men, including everything from skiing to climbing to freediving, I think the issue goes deeper than simple risk-aversion.

Less than one day later, Yuga Labs formally unveiled ApeCoin. Now as of today, Thursday, $APE is live for claiming by Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC), and Bored Ape Kennel Club (BAYC) holders, and the new ERC-20 token has already become the ~100th largest crypto by market cap. In other words, a lot has happened over the past 48 hours! So let’s dig in, catch up, and take a closer look at the birth of APE by the numbers. -WMP Rise of the Token of the Apes Intro to APE Yuga Labs unveiled APE, “a token for culture, gaming, and commerce used to empower a decentralized community building at the forefront of web3,” on Wednesday. In the same announcement, Yuga Labs revaled ApeCoin DAO , a “decentralized organization  … to vote on governance and use of the Ecosystem Fund,” and the Ape Foundation , the “legal steward of ApeCoin [that administers] the decisions made by the ApeCoin community.” Yuga Labs also announced that 62% of the 1B APE token supply would be allocated to the ApeCoin community over time, and 15% of the total supply, or 150M APE , would be claimable by Bored Ape ecosystem NFT holders as of 8:30 AM ET on Thursday, March 17th. Tracking the claims Web3 data scientist hildobby.eth created an ApeCoin Airdrop dashboard on Dune Analytics that makes it simple to track the key stats related to the release of APE. At the time of this post’s writing, the dashboard showed +9,774 addresses of the 15,208 eligible (~64%) had claimed their APE distributions, while +91M of the 150M airdropped APE (~60%) supply had already been claimed.","Dear Bankless Nation,On Tuesday, I speculated on how Yuga Labs’s acquisition of CryptoPunks and Meebits might affect the planned Bored Ape ecosystem token.Less than one day later, Yuga Labs formally unveiled ApeCoin.Now as of today, Thursday, $APE is live for claiming by Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC), and Bored Ape Kennel Club (BAYC) holders, and the new ERC-20 token has already become the ~100th largest crypto by market cap.In other words, a lot has happened over the past 48 hours! So let’s dig in, catch up, and take a closer look at the birth of APE by the numbers.-WMPRise of the Token of the ApesIntro to APEYuga Labs unveiled APE, “a token for culture, gaming, and commerce used to empower a decentralized community building at the forefront of web3,” on Wednesday.In the same announcement, Yuga Labs revaled ApeCoin DAO, a “decentralized organization  … to vote on governance and use of the Ecosystem Fund,” and the Ape Foundation, the “legal steward of ApeCoin [that administers] the decisions made by the ApeCoin community.”Yuga Labs also announced that 62% of the 1B APE token supply would be allocated to the ApeCoin community over time, and 15% of the total supply, or 150M APE, would be claimable by Bored Ape ecosystem NFT holders as of 8:30 AM ET on Thursday, March 17th.Tracking the claimsWeb3 data scientist hildobby.eth created an ApeCoin Airdrop dashboard on Dune Analytics that makes it simple to track the key stats related to the release of APE.

Regarding DEXes, Uniswap V2’s APE/WETH pool and Uniswap V3’s APE/ETH pool have already combined to facilitate +$300M in trading volume only hours after APE trading began. Sushi just added APE to its Onsen yield farming menu, too:As APE claims were linked to holding Bored Ape ecosystem NFTs, these digital collectibles have also unsurprisingly seen explosive trading volume over the past 24 hours. Indeed, BAYC, MAYC, and BAKC trading have astonishingly accounted for over 34,000 ETH in volume since Wednesday.Sign up for NansenEarly APE metricsImage via CoinGeckoWith a $790M market cap, APE is currently hovering around the position of the 104th largest crypto. This market cap already puts APE in the ballpark of DeFi heavyweights like Compound’s COMP ($765M) token and Curve DAO’s CRV ($837M) token. Moreover, APE’s fully diluted valuation (APE price multiplied by the 1B total APE supply) is presently ~$7.6B. For comparison, the current market cap of GameStop (GME) is ~$6.7B.Bits of intrigueSomeone used a MEV maneuver to claim 60k APE from the Bored Ape NFTX pool with a single transaction.Notice how right-click savers didn’t earn any APE?Mutant Serums (which are used to create MAYC NFTs) are additionally valuable during the ongoing 90-day APE claim period since MAYC holders can claim a sizable APE airdrop.There’s more to the APE tokenomics than meets the eye.What to watch out forYuga Labs’s acquisitions of Punks/Meebits, the launch of APE, and the company’s planned virtual land sales have positioned the team to be an extraordinarily influential Web3 media juggernaut going forward. Look for other top projects in the space to more aggressively pursue Yuga Labs’s recent playbook (acquisitions, token launches, etc.) as they attempt to play catch up!Action steps🔭 Check out the new ApeCoin website🧠 Read my previous post Bored Apes + CryptoPunks: the big ideas if you missed it",https://www.bankless.com/welcome-to-ape-world,2022-03-17T00:00:00.000Z,"https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/image/fetch/w_1200,h_600,c_limit,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https-3a-2f-2fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com-2fpublic-2fimages-2fa5b2333d-03e9-4198-b9e6-cfce95cc7d7b_1569x850.jpg",William M.

What are omnichain NFTs, though? If you’re in the dark here, no worries — the concept’s just begun to surge into the cryptoeconomy’s discourse over the past few weeks. Accordingly, let’s play catch up and see what all the buzz is about for today’s Metaversal . -WMP Understanding omnichain NFTs The context The recent boom of omnichain chatter largely stems from the rise of LayerZero Labs , a Canada-based team that has created the interoperability protocol LayerZero. If you want to dive deep, you can check out the protocol’s whitepaper. But simply put, LayerZero is a messaging transport layer designed to allow smart contracts to easily communicate among many, or rather any, blockchains. The protocol initially launched with support for projects that are compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), namely Ethereum, Arbitrum, Avalanche, BSC, Fantom, Optimism, and Polygon . Going forward, the LayerZero team also plans to add support for non-EVM chains like Cosmos Hub, Terra, and beyond. Comparing omnichain, crosschain, & multichain The LayerZero protocol functions similarly to the Cosmos ecosystem’s “layer zero” Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, at least in a general sense. Where LayerZero stands out is in its use of Ultra Light Nodes (ULNs) , which present a new model for securely transferring messages among chains in a cost-effective manner. Accordingly, LayerZero’s omnichain messaging model is distinct from the crosschain model , which entails using a bridge to directly migrate or wrap assets onto other chains. For example, if I bridge ETH over the Ronin bridge to use the Katana decentralized exchange, that’s a crosschain application, and my ETH directly moves from Ethereum to Ronin. The omnichain model is also contrastable with the multichain model , i.e. separate communities with distinct values pursuing their own tech stacks. Consider how the Ethereum community, per its values and infra, is pursuing self-sufficiency via trustless transfers among Ethereum and layer-two (L2) scaling solutions, while other alternative L1 ecosystems like Solana’s are taking their own distinct approaches to scaling.","Dear Bankless Nation,Everyone’s talking about omnichain NFTs lately.What are omnichain NFTs, though?If you’re in the dark here, no worries — the concept’s just begun to surge into the cryptoeconomy’s discourse over the past few weeks.Accordingly, let’s play catch up and see what all the buzz is about for today’s Metaversal.-WMPUnderstanding omnichain NFTsThe contextThe recent boom of omnichain chatter largely stems from the rise of LayerZero Labs, a Canada-based team that has created the interoperability protocol LayerZero.If you want to dive deep, you can check out the protocol’s whitepaper.

If you don’t make the best possible move, then you made a bad move. If you give your opponent an inch, they are sure to take it. If you leave anything on the table, someone will snatch it up. If you’re not competing for the #1 spot, then you’re at the mercy of someone else who is.Therefore, everyone must compete for the #1 spot. If you’re not playing for the #1 spot, then you’re not playing.Liquidity begets liquidity. Capital begets capital. Network effects beget network effects. The chain that wins is the one that captures all of these things.The fight to be Money is the fight of the crypto industry.‘Monetary premium’ is the most scarce resource in crypto. It’s the thing that every blockchain wants, but not every blockchain can have. Bitcoin has a lot of it. Ethereum has some. Every other chain has very little.There’s only so much monetary premium to go around.This is why we’re tribal. This is why crypto-twitter is toxic. This is why we fight all the time. There can only be one #1 crypto-network, and we all want to be it.Nation-states compete to be MoneyThis same competition occurs at the Nation-State level.If you zoom out to centuries-long time frames, you’ll see Nation-States jostling, colluding, and warring with each other to take the #1 spot in global power.Nation-States compete to obtain a monopoly on violence. Whichever country has the most powerful army gets to have the reserve currency for the world. They use their physical power to assert their currency as the global reserve currency.When your currency is the global reserve currency, you hold the world’s most powerful asset: the ability to print desired money.When the world uses your money, you have reached the peak of the jungle. You are the top dog. You have the one power that no one else has.Any subdominant nation-state can print money. But without the global demand to back it up, they can quickly print themselves into hyper-inflation if they’re not careful. Only the #1 Nation-State has the privilege of ‘sustainable’ money printing.When you have the #1 currency, the global demand for your asset mitigates much of the negative impact of money issuance. This is why the U.S. has been able to get away with it for so long; any new supply of dollars is immediately sucked up by global commerce due to the petro-dollar system.But wasteful spending and corruption is finally rearing its head, and the confidence of the U.S. dollar is waning.Just in time for credibly-neutral and incorruptible blockchain networks to take the place of the global reserve currency.Positive feedback loopThe Nation-State with the world’s reserve currency also has the world’s most powerful military—they go hand-in-hand. Military power secures the value of the currency by commanding global trade. It ensures that the global economy is always using its money (or else!).This manifests in a positive feedback loop of power. Once the #1 Nation-State spot is achieved, the costs of maintaining an army become cheaper thanks to control over the world’s reserve currency.The value of a dominant reserve currency further subsidizes military costs, which in turn cements the value of the currency, etc.Putting it in blockchain terminologyNation-State armies translate to blockchain security.Bitcoin’s army is its miners.Ethereum’s military is its stakers.Every blockchain has security expenditure. Blockchain sustainability is achieved by optimizing the amount of currency issued for security produced. How much security can you get for the minimum amount of money printing i.e., token inflation? Whichever blockchain answers this question best will likely find themselves at the #1 spot on CoinGecko (eventually).Blockchain security forces are strictly defense-only armies. No attack! Only defend.Proof-of-Work (PoW) erects a wall of electricity around the Bitcoin economy. Anyone with a shorter energy-wall cannot penetrate through the Bitcoin PoW force field.Proof-of-Stake (PoS) erects a wall of capital around the Ethereum economy. Anyone with a lesser amount of capital cannot penetrate through the walls that protect Ethereum.The price of BTC and ETH is a significant factor in how cheap security is for these ecosystems. If the assets of a chain increased 10x in value, then the security budget also increases by 10x. A 10x higher price means that the system can access 10x the level of security for the same amount of issuance.Monetary premium is security.The supply of Bitcoin hash power increases as the BTC price goes up.The incentive to stake ETH increases as the price of ETH goes up.BTC issuance is hard-programmed, so an increase in BTC value increases the security-expenditure of Bitcoin (at least until its block reward subsidy runs out!). This can lead to over-expenditure of security. If Bitcoin was secure at $1,000, it is 10x as secure at $10,000… but it still would have been secure anyways.In contrast, Ethereum has been more flexible with its issuance. As the price of ETH increased, the block reward issuance of ETH has been reduced:Block 0 to Block 4,369,999: 5 EtherBlock 4,370,000 to 7,280,000: 3 Ether (2017, changed via EIP-649)Block 7,280,000 to now: 2 Ether (2018, changed via EIP-1234)In 2021, EIP-1559 began recapturing excess ETH via fee burning.Later in 2022, issuance will be further reduced by 90% with the merge to PoS.Ethereum security philosophy’s is one of minimum viable issuance. How does Ethereum issue the least amount of ETH to achieve the required amount of security?Putting in back in Nation-State terms: How can we optimize our army to be maximally effective, for the least cost? Less tanks, more drones.The reduction of ETH issuance makes ETH more scarce, increasing its value on secondary markets. A higher price on the secondary market increases the security of Ethereum, creating a positive feedback loop where more security is achieved at less issuance.That’s monetary premium.Rollups: The Empire Model of SecurityEthereum’s modular design structure enables it to be infinitely scalable.Rather than trying to host an entire global economy on top of a single blockchain, Ethereum becomes the settlement layer for other blockchains.The U.S. has the most powerful military, and secures and facilitates global trade between countries, so long as they use the dollar.Ethereum has the highest security, and it secures and facilities global trade between L2s, so long as they use ETH to make an L1 transaction.The strength of the dollar doesn’t come from domestic production of the U.S. economy; it comes from external demand for dollars in order for countries to engage in global commerce. The U.S. doesn’t control the economy of Germany, France, Argentina, etc, but it still captures upside of these economies, because in order to trade with others, they must translate their GDP into dollar demand to import and export.Likewise, Ethereum doesn’t control the economies of L2 blockchains. Each L2 has complete sovereignty over its own economy. But when it comes to exporting the GDP from one rollup to another rollup, L2’s must consume ETH to make L1 transactions. Rolling up tens of thousands of transactions into a single L1 transaction is how the commerce on an L2 becomes interoperable with the rest of the Ethereum ecosystem.The beauty of Ethereum’s modular design is that you can append basically infinity L2s on it, making the Ethereum as an L1 the most fundamentally scalable blockchain design, allowing it to grow from a kingdom to an empire.The costs of spinning up a new L2 on Ethereum are close to zero. This is the equivalent of an empire simply manifesting new territories and economies out of thin air, so long as there is sufficient demand. Every new L2 adds to the net GDP of Ethereum, and Ethereum is free to add as many L2s as the market demands.As I wrote in 2020, all roads in Ethereum lead to ETH.Simplicity at the center, complexity at the marginsThe Federal / State structure of the U.S. is emulated in the L1 / L2 structure of modular Ethereum. Simplicity at the center; complexity at the margins.⚠️ Flaws in the U.S. System. I know there are differences between the theory of the US model versus how it has manifested in reality. The U.S. is far from perfect. I’m ignoring these imperfections to drive home the point in this article.The Federal government of the United States is the L1. It determines the universal ‘meta-laws’ that all states (L2s) abide by. These meta-laws are designed to facilitate interoperability between the States. It enables trust for efficient interstate commerce.For example, the FDA maintains food standards across states, making sure that food can be traded across states with assurances that one state won’t sell tainted food to another. The EPA maintains environmental regulations, ensuring that the negative environmental externalities of one state doesn’t impact the economies of other states.But the Federal government is supposed to only offer the minimum amount of rules and regulations needed to produce a ‘United States’.  All other laws and rules are left up for the individual states (L2s) to decide for themselves.This same pattern exists on Ethereum.The law of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) on the Ethereum L1 is designed to coordinate economic resources across the L2s. The EVM is the shared set of laws that all L2s agree to abide by, and this common standard is how L2s can share in the economic upside of each other’s growth. What is good for New York is much better for California than it is for Canada!Sharing the same L1 protocol is how each independent blockchain turns from antagonistic to aligned. The success of an L2 rollup on Ethereum has positive externalities for other L2 rollups on Ethereum, due to the interoperability on the underlying L1 chain. There is shared upside among the United L2s.The beauty of the L2/States rights model is that every L2/State gets to determine what works best for themselves. Ethereum doesn’t determine the laws of the L2; only the laws required for inter-L2 coordination.An L2 rollup can be:An optimistic rollup like Optimism, or ArbitrumA zk-rollup like zkSync or StarknetA validium like Immutable XA centralized ledger like Coinbase or Wells FargoA consortium chain like HyperledgerYour own personal playground, for whatever reason.There are no limitations on how to construct an L2 on Ethereum; only that you must abide by the interoperability standard of the EVM.Complexity at the edges, simplicity at the centerThis illustrates the principle of ‘complexity at the edges, simplicity at the center”, a shared principle found throughout nature.It’s how organisms grow; genetic code at the center, genetic expression at the margins. This is how an app-store works; a basic distribution platform at the center, developer innovation at the edges. This is the Federal/States model; meta-laws at the center, innovation at the edges. This is the modular Ethereum structure; the EVM at the center, L2s at the margins.‘Simplicity at the center’ maximizes the expression of the margins. Enable the humans of the world to build whatever their heart desires, and they’ll create something amazing. Restrict humans with overbearing laws and regulations and you’ll stifle innovation and progress. Do one thing and do it well, while enabling a developer/entrepreneur ecosystem to flourish to take things the rest of the way.Voting with your feet/moneyThe L1/L2, Federal/State model is an individual empowerment mechanism.Is your state becoming coercive and domineering? Are they extracting more taxes from you than services they provide? Your solution is easy: move to a different state.With the States model, the ability for an individual to exit from a coercive state of affairs is a check on the coercive state. Because individuals can leave, states must compete with each other to make their constituents happy and retain their residency. States that do this better are rewarded with more economic resources and more people moving in.The same dynamic will play out in L2s.Is your L2 charging too high fees? Is it making sufficient investment into its infrastructure to make life easier for its users? Is it keeping up with the pace of innovation, or is it falling behind?If the L2 you’re on isn’t up to your satisfaction, you can just hop to a different one. L2s will compete with each other for users and their money, and this competition is good for the user.Who pays taxes to who?Ethereum is a modern instantiation of the same patterns of global coordination we’ve seen throughout the millennia.Kingdoms produce armies to battle other kingdoms. The winning kingdom subsumes the loser kingdom, and the loser kingdom begins paying taxes to the winning kingdom empire. The empire would then become responsible for protecting its new sub-kingdom from external attack by leveraging the resources inside the new sub-kingdom to bolster its army and grow its reach.As soon as humans evolved from hunter-gatherers to settled agrarian society (the same moment we established the idea of ‘property’), the question of “Who pays taxes to who” became the foundational question of human coordination.Over the ages, this process has become less and less violent, but the fundamental structure is the same. The US doesn’t maintain its empire by violence (okay, often it does), but instead by ensuring global trade is denominated in its currency.The Ethereum EmpireThe Ethereum empire will grow in two ways:New L2s are created and added to the ecosystemInsecure L1s roll themselves up into Ethereum L2sAdding new rollups is quick and easy. Rollups (Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync) are produced internally; they leave the congestion of the central empire and establish new subkingdoms outside the main castle.These new satellites of Ethereum govern themselves and produce their own economies. But after every few blocks, they bundle up their aggregate economic activity and make a transaction to the L1. In exchange for an ETH tax to process a transaction, the security power of the Ethereum L1 is bestowed on the L2.Other L1s turning into Ethereum L2s is a more complex story.Summarized: Alt L1 chains issue more currency than Ethereum to pay for lesser security. If they want to stop inflating their currency, they can just choose to be protected by Ethereum instead.The Numbers:Ethereum is currently inflating @ 4.15% while providing $45m in daily security payments to its network (this does not include the burn, which reduces inflation!).The monetary premium that BTC currently holds is evident here. It’s only inflating @ 1.7%, yet is providing $40m in daily security.BTC is inflating 2.4x less than ETH, while producing 89% of the security of Ethereum. That's 2.7x more efficient security! Too bad it can’t do smart contracts, otherwise I’d probably be way more bullish BTC. No smart contracts = no DeFi & no L2s.You can see the following metrics at MoneyPrinter.infoSolana is inflating @ 7%, while only achieving $11m in daily security. That’s 1.75x more issuance than ETH, while achieving only 24.4% of Ethereum’s security. Ethereum has 7.17x more efficient security than Solana.AVAX is inflating @ 5.5%, while achieving $5.7m in daily security. That’s 1.3x more issuance than ETH, while achieving only 12.5% of Ethereum’s security. Ethereum has 10.4x more efficient security than Avalanche.This is before Ethereum switches to Proof of Stake (which Solana and Avalanche already are), and the issuance of ETH drops 90%, while simultaneously strengthening its security mechanism.⚠️ Note: Although this is a very big piece of the puzzle, this is not a holistic illustration of all the variables that go into security. A deep dive into that subject is outside the scope of this article.The Monolithic TrapThis is the trap that ‘scaled’ Monolithic blockchains fall into. Both Avalanche and Solana market themselves as the low-fee L1, but this property forces them into issuing more currency to pay for security. Both Solana and Avalanche have much higher throughputs than Ethereum. They produce more total blockspace to host more data. If you have more blockspace, you have to increase the security spend to defend that extra space.More blocks require more armies!Scaling a monolithic kingdom is like expanding the fortress walls out further and further out, rather than allowing people to leave the Kingdom to produce satellite settlements.In order to differentiate from Ethereum, alt L1s have increased their L1 throughput in order to reduce fees. The consequences of this are likely catastrophic for the long-term monetary premium of these L1 chains. This design choice creates high issuance while also limiting how much fees can be collected.More issuance, less fees. This kills the monetary premium.In contrast, Ethereum’s priority of decentralization at the L1 and scalability at the L2 produces high L1 fees, while minimizing the need to issue ETH.Less issuance, more fees. This is how you produce a monetary premium.With the issuance already minimized, the fee burn from EIP-1559 captures the economic energy of the Ethereum ecosystem, and injects it into the value of ETH (by making it more scarce). ETH value goes up, requiring less ETH to be issued to pay for security. This issuance reduction increases the scarcity of ETH, increasing its value, and further reducing the need to issue. It’s a positive feedback loop into monetary premium.Chains that attempt to scale at the L1 have a positive feedback loop in the opposite direction. Scaled L1s require high issuance, and cannot capture meaningful fee revenue. This forces supply inflation, decreasing its scarcity and putting downwards pressure on the currency. It cannot subsidize issuance with fees, because that’s antithetical to the purpose of these Alt L1s. As more and more issuance occurs, the lowered value of the currency (due to inflation) incurs further issuance demands.Now, these Alt L1 assets can still go up in price, causing a reduction of the need to issue. But remember what I said at the beginning of this article:Blockchains are like chess: Making a good move isn’t enough. If you don’t make the best possible move available to you, then you made a bad move.Even if an Alt L1 currency goes up in price, the fundamentals of a scaled L1 blockchain are always that it has to issue more than a decentralized L1 blockchain.The playing field for the fight to be the #1 L1 blockchain is always tilted towards who can issue the least currency to achieve the maximum amount of security. If you have security, you can have everything. If security is expensive for you, then your options are limited.If you’re not playing to be an empire of blockchain networks, then you’re not playing at all.The Alt L1 Game of Chicken 🐔Optimism and Arbitrum are already functioning L2s, and they don’t even have tokens (yet). They’re economically viable without any issuance. They generate revenue by selling blocks, and then they pay a little bit in taxes to the Ethereum economy every time they make an L1 transaction.Avalanche, Solana, Terra, and basically all blockchains with subdominant security all have a hole in their boat. Their boat is leaking, and the longer they let inflation go rampant, the worse the problem gets.By becoming an Ethereum L2, their issuance (the source of the leak) can drop to 0. They instantly become revenue-positive, and they can even increase the throughput of their chain.All Alt L1 blockchains are in a game-of-chicken.Will they ever get it? No one wants to bend the knee. Hubris and ego get in the way.The arguments articulated in this article are generally why alt L1 communities illustrate me as an ‘ETH Maxi’.In reality, it’s decentralization maximalism that is what enables this empire model of blockchains to exist. Ethereum’s commitment to a decentralized L1 and constrained L1 blockspace is how it creates a vibrant and rich L2 ecosystem. It’s how we produce a network of blockchains that extend the decentralization and security of Ethereum’s L1 to an infinite array of L2 blockchains. Not having to be concerned about security puts winds on the backs of these L2s, allowing them to scale much further than any L1 ever could.We just need to get past this awkward L2 bootsrapping phase, in which alternative L1s have found a niche to thrive in the confusion.Just as all roads lead to Rome, all chains lead to Ethereum.- DavidAction steps📖 Read Ethereum is an Emergent Structure🎓 Understand what it takes for a blockchain to be profitable🎧 Listen to 5 things to know about the ETH 2.0 Merge",https://www.bankless.com/the-empire-model-for-blockchains,2022-04-13T00:00:00.000Z,"https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/image/fetch/w_1200,h_600,c_limit,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https-3a-2f-2fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com-2fpublic-2fimages-2fafb294fd-2f0a-4dfc-8f91-162b6207079f_2667x1500.jpg",David Hoffman,Bankless,blog,Unknown Error,

Basically, every team and company present at DevConnect would like to 2x the size of their developer team, but there simply isn’t enough talent to go around . If you have the skills required to work for L2 teams or be a protocol dev, or generally just work in open source software, then you likely already work for one of these companies and are being paid very well. And it’s not like there’s this other pool of Web2 talent that these teams can pull from. The talent required to actually be helpful on the frontier of research and development is extremely specific, and this talent has likely already been in the space for a long time. We need talented engineers from Web2 to drop what they’re doing, lock themselves in their basements for months, go down the crypto-network rabbit hole, and then reemerge as viable talent for Web3 companies. I asked Bartek to illustrate what talent he needs for L2Beat.com; here’s what he said: What are people waiting for?? And then, we need this new talent to not be corrupted by the mountains of capital that are accruing to those who participate in unethical and network-destabilizing MEV extraction. The Final Takeaway This week in Amsterdam is a testament to Ethereum’s slime-mold nature. Ethereum development is relentless developing on all fronts, all at once. When there’s this much brainpower going into something, it’s unstoppable. Unlike reports I’ve heard about other conferences, ( that they’re a pile of money searching for a soul ""), the environment at DevConnect was passionate builders tackling the hardest problems in crypto; problems that other ecosystems aren’t even bothering to consider, yet are foundational to the longevity of this industry. DevConnect was saturated with the latter. Not a moonboi in sight. Let’s get busy. - David","Dear Bankless Nation,I just got back from DevConnect in Amsterdam.DevConnect was organized by the Ethereum Foundation, with the goal of getting all the Ethereum developers in one spot, so they can all sync on progress.The amount of progress that was made in the last week was insane. Not just from the ETH core devs and client teams, but for the surrounding ecosystem participants too. The L2 teams synced at an L2 summit, DeFi projects gave out bounties at the Hackathon. Web2 to Web3 bootcamps onboarded new devs across things like StarkNet, zkRollups, IPFS, light client tech, and so much more.I’ve been to a lot of conferences in the last 18 months, and this one was unlike any other. People were here to build.I was chatting with an Ethereum developer, Alex Stokes, and he said “we’ve achieved months worth of All-Core-Dev calls all in this one week of time”.Shit got done at DevConnect 💪👷‍♂️🛠So much was learned during this magical week, and I want to share it all with you.Here are my 5 takeaways from DevConnect 👇1. The MEV problem is criticalThe highlight of DevConnect was MEV.day (Friday).All of the greatest minds in the same came together to discuss: What the hell are we going to do with this massive MEV problem that’s insidiously growing?Justin Drake—the cryptography maximalist—gave a talk about how all MEV problems are solved with cryptography.Vitalik gave a talk on block Proposer-Builder Separation (PBS), Danksharding, and MEV in ETH 2. It was pretty complicated; most went over my head so I still need to take some time to digest it. Here are the slides for those interested.Even Hasu gave a presentation, beamed in from an external location (although rumor is he was physically present).MEV on ETH2: MEV-boost, PBS, Danksharding... How do the pieces fit together?Phil Daian, the man who discovered the existence of MEV in the first place, gave an updated talk titled “MEV... wat do next?” on the current state of MEV.Here are his slides.According to Phil… the situation is pretty dire.I’ve taken 5 slides from his talk, and added a summary to each one:Once they’re uploaded, talks will be available here.2. Ethereum devs are not playing aroundDevConnect is exactly what the name implies: all the devs getting in one place and connecting.There were two things that had complete consensus by everyone I talked to at DevConnect.Amsterdam is an amazing city.Everyone got a ton of work done.It was pretty surreal to see Danny Ryan, Justin Drake, Vitalik, Dankrad, Preston Van Loon, and so many other core devs, client devs, and researchers all packed into one room, looking at a whiteboard or monitor.I lost track of the number of times I heard about a successful ‘shadowfork’ (where devs forked the Ethereum main chain, to do a “practice Merge”).‘The Merge’ is what mainstream knows is on the horizon for Ethereum, but there’s also so much development occurring with other aspects Ethereum too, as shown in Trent’s tweet above.Ethereum development is tackling many problems in parallel, making on-site workshops an incredibly valuable time to cross-pollinate the development efforts of all the tracks.3. L2 wars are going to be spicy 🌶 🔥🌶While the ETH devs were focused on the Merge and Beyond 🔜™️, the L2 teams were at Layer Two Amsterdam.Dankrad Feist opened up the day with a talk that outlined the 6 big checkboxes that L2s all need to work on. Every major L2 team was present, and it was immensely useful to have Dankrad illustrate what’s left to do for the L2 ecosystem before we can claim a job well done.Here’s Dankrads “Big Five” checklist for L2s:Parallelize execution (1 cpu core → many cpu cores = faster Rollups!)Support light clients (no data centers for Rollup nodes! Laptops pls!)Make scalable escape hatches (User empowerment & soverignty!)Business Development (Need to onboard business use cases!)Figure out governance (Tokens?? but how??)You can see Dankrad’s slides here (but you’ll likely need to watch the talk too, video not yet uploaded).Next came Bartek from L2beat.com, who presented his “Risk Framework”, an effort of putting definitions and standards on the variables that L2s differentiate on.Here’s Barteks slides.All talks will be available here, once they’re uploaded.The conclusions from these first two context-setting talks:L2s teams have their work cut out for themThese are non-trivial problems, but we have known paths forward. All that’s left is execution.This is all setting the stage for the coming L2 wars. As L2s all progress on this front, there will be jostling and positioning to prove who is furthest on this checklist.During Bartek’s talk, he was discussing the various risks and gaps left in the current state of L2s. Each ‘unfinished’ aspect of L2s leaves a gap in user safety, and these ‘gaps’ are not 1:1 equivalent across rollups; each different rollup design has its own unique risks, even if they largely fit under the same categories.For example, Bartek brought up Arbitrum’s 12-hour sequencer downtime last September, which conveniently occurred during Solana’s 17-hour downtime, and allowed us to compare the differences between the properties of L1 and L2 downtimes.Throughout Crypto Twitter and the Ethereum community, it was echoed that “With L2s, if the sequencer goes down, you can still make L2 transactions with the L1!”.L2s are like escalators: when they break, they just turn into stairs. You can still use them.While Bartek was discussing this, he said “People thought you could still make a transaction on Arbitrum… but that was wrong: you actually couldn’t, citing the not-yet-finished state of the L2 ecosystem.I was sitting in front of members of the Arbitrum team, and could hear murmers of displeasure and disagreement from this statement from Bartek. Eventually, someone loudly said “That’s not true!” from the audience. Discussing with other L2 teams, they said “actually it was true”, which is going straight to the point of what Bartek was talking about:We don’t have risk frameworks or standards for discussing the variances in L2 rollup design, which is why we have disagreements about what’s true versus what’s not.Bartek is clearly passionate about this, and looking at the risk page of L2beat.com, you can see all the various risk vectors of L2s, and the various levels of assurances that L2s give (or don’t!) about failure scenarios.The tl;dr: everyone knows #L2-22 is on the horizon, and L2 teams are going to be jostling for mindshare and market share… because everyone agrees:It’s time for L2s to shine.4️⃣ EVM equivalence is *required*EVM equivalence wasn’t in the center of attention at DevConnect… but it should have been.The MEV teams focused on MEV. The Ethereum developers focused on Ethereum. The L2 teams focused on L2s.Meanwhile, I focused on this concept called ‘EVM equivalence’, and now it’s living rent-free in my head.Ethereum’s network effects stopped growing when gas sustained 300+ gwei during DeFi summer. This is the moment when Ethereum became a whale chain, and new users were pushed to other chains.Some went to L2s like Polygon, and later Arbitrum when it came online in September. Many went to EVM-compatible L1s like Avalanche or Fantom. Others went to new chains with completely new non-EVM standards like Solana or Terra.Other than those that stayed on the Ethereum L1, everyone went to chains that were not EVM equivalent.Sure, Polygon and Arbitrum are EVM-compatible Ethereum L2s, adding to Ethereum's network effects, and sharing in Ethereum’s security.But EVM compatibility is still a divergence from the network effects of the EVM, fracturing the network effects that put Ethereum on the global map.If we want to pick up where we left off in DeFi summer 2020, we need EVM equivalency.Only with an ecosystem of EVM equivalent ORUs can we continue growing the network effects of the EVM. Mere EVM compatibility isn’t going to cut it.Thankfully, Optimism has had this since last October, and Arbitrum has begun to follow suit with Nitro.My opinion is: EVM compatibility is dead; either go full EVM equivalent like Optimism or Arbitrum or just build a completely fresh execution environment that doesn’t have the technical baggage of the EVM.This is a new concept for me but I’m going down the rabbit hole.More on this on Wednesday in the newsletter.5️⃣ There's not enough talentEveryone is hiring, and the pool of talent that everyone is hiring from is not growing fast enough.Basically, every team and company present at DevConnect would like to 2x the size of their developer team, but there simply isn’t enough talent to go around.If you have the skills required to work for L2 teams or be a protocol dev, or generally just work in open source software, then you likely already work for one of these companies and are being paid very well.And it’s not like there’s this other pool of Web2 talent that these teams can pull from.The talent required to actually be helpful on the frontier of research and development is extremely specific, and this talent has likely already been in the space for a long time.We need talented engineers from Web2 to drop what they’re doing, lock themselves in their basements for months, go down the crypto-network rabbit hole, and then reemerge as viable talent for Web3 companies.I asked Bartek to illustrate what talent he needs for L2Beat.com; here’s what he said:What are people waiting for??And then, we need this new talent to not be corrupted by the mountains of capital that are accruing to those who participate in unethical and network-destabilizing MEV extraction.The Final TakeawayThis week in Amsterdam is a testament to Ethereum’s slime-mold nature.

Dune dashboard by mhonkasalo","Metaversal is a Bankless newsletter for weekly level-ups on NFTs, virtual worlds, & collectibles.Dear Bankless Nation,OpenSea is where most NFTs are listed for sale.Yet lately a growing number of people have been actually buying their NFTs through the marketplace aggregator Gem, which makes it easy to purchase batches of assets from across OpenSea and beyond.Now, OpenSea has consolidated by acquiring Gem, and it’s a move that’s generated no shortage of discussion and debate across the NFT ecosystem.For today’s Metaversal, let’s get you up to speed on the big ideas of this huge acquisition.-WMPA Gem in the OpenSeaThis week OpenSea, the world’s largest NFT marketplace, announced its acquisition of NFT marketplace aggregator Gem.What’s GemGem is an NFT marketplace aggregator, i.e. a platform that makes it easy to buy and list NFTs across multiple NFT marketplaces simultaneously.Gem launched to the public in Jan. 2022, and afterwards the platform quickly became a darling among NFT veterans and novices alike for its slick UX and gas efficiencies. The project currently supports NFT trading across OpenSea, Larva Labs, LooksRare, NFTX, and X2Y2.Want to learn more about NFT marketplace aggregators? See my tactic How to Sweep NFT floors in Bankless from Feb. 2022.The big pictureBeyond being the most used NFT platform, OpenSea announced its $300M Series C funding round (raised at a whopping $13.3B valuation!) in Jan. 2022. Accordingly, OpenSea has incredible social inertia and also a major war chest of value, and it will continue to use the latter to boost the former. The Gem acquisition is thus OpenSea’s latest muscular move to further consolidate its juggernaut status in the NFT ecosystem.What they’re sayingDevin Finzer, OpenSea co-founder and CEO said:“Gem has built an amazing product with the leading feature set for pro users, growing seemingly overnight in community engagement and enthusiasm.

Plenty of people have veered the other way and are now considering it a foregone conclusion that Gem won’t launch one post-acquisition per OpenSea’s lack of token plans to date.Personally, I do think it’s likely at some point that the OpenSea ecosystem releases a token in some form, and as Gem co-founder Vasa has asserted that “Rewards/Tokens are not out of the question,” the possibility of a GEM token appears to still be in play. On the flip side, it’s all but clear that fellow NFT marketplace aggregator Genie will release a GENIE token at some point, but watch out for scam tokens that try to capitalize on the pre-hype buzz in the meantime.Action steps💎 Check out Gem🔴 Did you ever try the Quixotic NFT marketplace after reading my Trying NFTs on Optimism article?

Let’s lay out the big ideas and get you up to speed on all the chatter for today’s Metaversal.-WMPIf at first you don’t succeed …Setting the sceneThe disastrous $UST de-pegging event, which saw the value of Terra’s native dollar-pegged stablecoin temporarily crater below $0.70, made Monday, April 9th, a day for the cryptoeconomy’s history books in its own right.Accordingly, surges of panicky DeFi activity combined with growing concerns over macroeconomic conditions led to risk-off movements across all top cryptocurrencies and NFT collections on the day.Thus many NFTers were already baffled and trying to wrap their heads around all the crypto and UST chaos when they were later hit with yet another dramatic blindside, this time from within the NFT ecosystem in the form of this post from Zagabond, one of the founders of Azuki:The revelations“Builders must learn from each experience, coming back to the drawing board with something innovative and significant each time. [...] This team pushes tech forward, and advocates for meaningful art, as well as deep, immersive storytelling. Azuki is our vision for the future of web3.” — ZagabondDubbed A Builder’s Journey, Zagabond’s confessional post details how Azuki was “built on learnings from … other projects, which taught me to lead, not follow.” The other projects Zagabond admitted to building were CryptoPhunks (an anti-Larva Labs CryptoPunks parody project), Tendies (a chicken-themed riff on the My Fucking Pickles collection), and CryptoZunks (billed as “the last 10,000 CryptoPunks”).Zagabond concluded the write-up by saying these projects informed the creation of Chiru Labs in September 2021 and that Chiru Labs wouldn’t have been able to make Azuki what it is without these experiences. He also doubled down by saying “Azuki is our vision for the future of web3” and that the project was part of a broader movement.“I joined the crypto space years ago because I believed that the web3 community collectively could shift the balance of power away from centralized web2 companies,” Zagabond said. “Let’s continue to share our learnings in order to push the space forward.”Critics cry foulLearning from past experiences is the basis of progress. But what those experiences were definitely matters, especially if other people were repeatedly taken advantage of along the way. Do Zagabond’s now abandoned pre-Azuki projects meet this bar of manipulation? Some people say no, or at least aren’t so sure:However, plenty of others have gone further in outlining and criticizing the implications of the revelations. For example, renowned on-chain sleuth ZachXBT posted a thread highlighting the controversies associated with Phunks, Tendies, and Zunks, and the various stories aren’t pretty.Loose on morals, fast and fickle with development. That’s been the model of these past projects, so the unsavory revelations have cast a newfound pall over the Azuki collection as such.Aesthetically, organizationally, and technically speaking, Azuki is certainly the highest quality work Zagabond and co. have done yet, and it may indeed be the “forever project” they settle into and find a lot more success with over time. Regardless, the collection’s links to multiple corrupt efforts has now called its future prospects into question like never before.The matter of timingThese links to controversial collections are obviously very unflattering for Azuki’s creators, which is why it’s all the more interesting that Zagabond voluntarily admitted them how he did. What gives?Some people speculated that Chiru Labs was trying to bury the hatchet on bad news (which they figured would come out eventually) on a day when the $UST chaos could mute some of the impact. Other rumors have suggested the announcement was an attempt to preempt a third party from breaking the news first. We may never get the actual answer, but the genie’s out of the bottle in any case.Azuki price actionImage via NFT Price FloorAfter trading at +31 ETH just one week ago and as high as 22 ETH on Sunday, floor-value Azukis were fetching sellers just shy of 15 ETH by the end of yesterday. BEANZ, the first extension collection for Azuki holders, have faced a similarly sharp downturn, as the project’s floor prices have slid from 6.86 ETH to 2.19 ETH over the past week.The big pictureChiru Labs may take the Azuki universe on to new heights from here, and these revelations may end up just being a blip in the road for them. However, a considerable number of people have rightfully lost confidence and trust in the project in light of these controversies, and that’s the Azuki project’s cross to bear for now. How or if they’ll redeem themselves to these dissatisfied people remains to be seen.Action steps🔍 Read A Builder’s Journey by Zagabond🧐 Catch up on last week’s NFT happenings with my previous write-up, Your NFT edge",https://www.bankless.com/azuki-nft-drama-,2022-05-10T00:00:00.000Z,"https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/image/fetch/w_1200,h_600,c_limit,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https-3a-2f-2fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com-2fpublic-2fimages-2f934efa73-b7ab-4e60-b1a3-821a8020eaa3_1200x740.jpg",William M.

Full post-mortem tomorrow on the newsletter.Why we need web3 social platformsGraphic by Logan CraigIs there a Big Tech censorship bias?A hot topic in contemporary politics over recent years is censorship/moderation bias on Big Tech platforms.For years, the political Right has complained incessantly of Silicon Valley’s alleged political bias. Their grievances of Big Tech’s bias culminated in Twitter’s Trump ban during the 2020 presidential elections (Trump sued and the lawsuit got thrown out of court this week).It’s a plausible narrative held together by anecdotal evidence.Yet it’s also true that many on the right enjoy a prominent presence across all major social media platforms.In the months leading up to the 2020 Election Day, Trump dominated Biden on Facebook engagement at a 87% to 13% ratio. Brad Parscale, Trump’s social media director stated plainly that “Facebook and Twitter were the reason we won [the 2016 elections]”In 2019, all partisan right-wing YouTube channels (e.g. Fox News, Daily Wire), received 662 million in “hours watched”, slightly higher than the 659 million hours that partisan left-wing channels (e.g. CNN, MSNBC) racked up.Even Google has been accused of skewing search results in a way that favors liberal results though these claims have been challenged by The Economist and Stanford research.And Republicans aren’t alone in thinking Big Tech hates them. The Left too has expressed the belief that Big Tech unfairly persecutes their side. The outcry against Elon Musk’s recent purchase of twitter by the Left may have more to do with fears that twitter’s censorship policy may move against them.Vitalik put it this way:
Depending on which side of the political aisle you call home, there’s a different media narrative around Big Tech censorship for you to embrace.It’s easy to ply the “Web2 bad, Web3 good” narrative here and throw the blame at the feet of Big Tech content moderators. But the reality is that when you moderate millions of hours of content, you have to rely on algorithms.When you rely on algorithms, inconsistencies and mistakes are bound to happen. Pleasing everyone is impossible.The algorithms become the censors.Codified language in official “content moderation policies” cannot possibly ex-ante anticipate all wrongdoings. The language is vague, so Big Tech moderators have leeway to interpret what counts as a transgression in the context of an ever-changing cultural landscape where gender, racial, and linguistic norms that were considered okay ten years ago would be considered in bad taste today.It’s why traditional newsrooms have editorial discretion to decide what to include or exclude and also why legal scholars continue to debate the true meaning of the American constitution after it was written two and a half centuries later.The perils of centralizationThis is less about who Big Tech may or may not be biased against. That will change with different owners and regimes. The more interesting question is “Why is there so much disputed debate and uncertainty over bias?”It’s hard to deny that the reasons surrounding social media regulation are often seemingly arbitrary and opaque. Big Tech companies are, after all, centralized. Their inner workings aren’t transparent because their algorithms are intellectual property worth billions.Asking them to make their algorithms public is akin to asking Coca-Cola to unveil the recipe of its iconic soft drink.But at the root of the debate around censorship bias lies the lack of credible neutrality, a concept that Vitalik has often brought up in the context of Web3.Credible neutrality can be simply summed up as such: Whatever decision is reached, its decision-making (and the rules that govern that process) should be created as transparently and equitably, and non-discriminatory as possible.In legal philosophy, this is known as the rule of law. It’s a meta-legal doctrine that first-world courts of law adhere to. It’s what distinguishes dictatorships and the free world. Rule of law empowers people with a sufficiently wide (but not maximalist) scope of freedom so they can pursue their lives without being subject to the arbitrary whims of another man’s will.Fair rules/laws are non-discriminatory and crafted in ignorance of application to any specific citizen, or business industry. In contrast, laws are unfair when they seek to single out persons and outlaw specific behaviors/traits. Common examples of such laws include those that punish the higher-income (progressive taxes), that discriminate against minorities (slavery, apartheid), or laws that favor specific industries (protectionist tariffs).Big Tech’s content moderation algorithms may not necessarily suffer from a calculated political bias, but the problem is that its decision-making (the laws) isn’t transparent. That’s why it breeds so much discontent on all sides of the political spectrum—it lacks “rule of law”.When punishment is meted out, the rules are unclear. We don’t know why or how those conclusions are reached. Cue the game of whataboutism.As a result, social media users, entrepreneurs, and companies like Bankless, are subject to the erratic pendulum of Big Tech’s arbitrary content moderation, swinging in random directions at the whim of any given moment, penalizing some and favoring others.Blockchains provide a solution to centralized social mediaArbitrary censorship in Big Tech stresses the importance of using peer-to-peer systems technology to decentralize our content streams.Blockchains provide that first step towards addressing the power imbalance in the current social media landscape, and establishing credible neutrality. It’s a public ledger in which laws (smart contracts) are publicly accessible and certain. In short, it imbues the rule of law into the digital commons.Just as blockchains are decentralizing financial ownership, they are also providing a valuable pathway to decentralizing ownership over social capital—our reputation and connections online. It’s an opportunity to remedy the power imbalances in the Web2 status quo, and tilt profit streams and platform governance back in favor of the average user.Web3 Social is ComingIt’s early days for the social Web3 space but already there exists a variety of projects that are building decentralized products at the crossroads of social media and digital assets.The Aave-backed Lens Protocol is one prominent social Web3 protocol working to create a decentralized version of a social graph—a backbone tool of all social media networks that map out user relationships. Lens users will own everything as fully composable NFTs, from your own profile to the content that you share, down to social interactions like a ""Follow"" or ""Like"", letting users monetize these digital assets in different ways.There are whole social-specific blockchains like the Layer-1 DeSo (short for “decentralized social”), a fully open-sourced chain currently hosting 200+ applications.DeSo’s approach resembles a “Layer-0” design, where any user in the blockchain ecosystem can easily transport their profile to a different application, creating interoperability between many different apps. Similar to Lens, DeSo is designed to store all social media interactions on-chain.One application on DeSo is Entre, which has merged a smorgasbord of Web2 functionalities across tweeting, talent recruitment, video conferencing and calendar meetings.Then there’s Minds, a decentralized open-source Facebook built on Arweave (its MINDS token is an ERC-20), Mastodon, a federated Twitter platform, Odysee, a decentralized YouTube on the LBRY blockchain that hosted Bankless content even during its brief downtime, the Polkadot-based Subsocial, a DeFi-meets-social platform which facilitates anyone to begin building a social network on top of it, and of course Jack Dorsey’s Bluesky.What distinguishes many of these applications from their Web2 counterparts aren’t the front-end experience, but the back-end aspects of governance and ownership.By running these apps on public blockchains, it opens up a world of possibilities that wasn’t previously possible in Web2. Anyone can run nodes, access its smart contracts and fork projects. By integrating decentralized tools from Web3, they reduce the number of centralized choke points that exist in the technical infrastructure of the Web2 status quo.The Future of Social MediaBut most existing social Web3 projects are still in a nascent stage of experimentation. The infrastructure isn’t quite ready yet. We’ve only started waking up to the problems of centralized social media in recent years.The end game is a social media metaverse where users can access audiences while establishing property rights over their social reputations in an interoperable world. And for once, blockchain technology is enabling entrepreneurs to take credible steps towards that ideal.Web3 is coming to eat Web2’s lunch and the Big Tech giants are pivoting quickly to protect their lunchboxes. They are integrating Web3 capabilities into their platform, like Twitter and Instagram have done with NFTs, or banks/Fintechs with crypto payments.The net outcome is a positive-sum improvement for the social media experience and that’s very much welcome.Action steps⬆️  Level up on web3 social with Lens Protocol, DeSo, and others📖  Read Donovan’s previous article “Bull Case for CC0”",https://www.bankless.com/bankless-banned-from-youtube,2022-05-11T00:00:00.000Z,"https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/image/fetch/w_1200,h_600,c_limit,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https-3a-2f-2fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com-2fpublic-2fimages-2fab3894c0-1fde-42de-ab9d-d88fd93473d4_798x449.jpg",Donovan Choy,Bankless,blog,Unknown Error,

Bring on the bear market.,,"Dear Bankless Nation, It’s difficult to be optimistic about crypto right now. Markets are in the gutter. Inflation rages. Recession looms.

Here are three reasons why:1. The Dewy Leaves of L2 SpringWandering the Palm Beach Convention Center, I was blown away by the sheer number of teams I met that are building on Ethereum L2s.Synthetix, Lyra Finance, Tracer DAO, Galleon DAO made up a big presence at the conference. Upgrades like Tracer’s Perpetual Pools V2 were rolled-out from the conference floor itself.On stage at Permissionless, Ethereum core devs Preston van Loon and Justin Drake signaled August as launch month for the long-awaited 2.0 Merge. 🤯**Check out Bankless’ previous piece on why the Merge is a game-changer.**The halls were also filled with growing support behind the L2-friendly EIP-4844— AKA danksharding.All this lead to one thing: L2 Spring.While the fabled L2 Summer' has yet to fully arrive, I think we are in the midst of an L2 Spring. The enthusiasm and quality of teams building out this new frontier is palpable and the dissipation of bull market noise has only increased their focus and drive, leaving me more excited than ever for the future of Ethereum scaling.2. Nobody’s Jumping Ship, They’re Too Busy ShippingTrue crypto natives stick around regardless of price.

Inflation rages. Recession looms. Hacks, scams, and scandals run rampant through Web3. And we’re still digging through the wreckage of Terra’s fall to Earth, which saw the destruction of tens of billions in value.Witnessing the carnage of my first ever crypto bear market unfold, I admit I’m shaken. People are calling this the worst shock to crypto since Mt. Gox.I’ve been guided by a belief that decentralization is the great force for good in my lifetime—that’s why I work at Bankless—yet the events of the past few weeks have caused me to question my beliefs more than ever.The Permissionless conference over the weekend changed all of that. It showed me that bear markets are where the learning, the building, the actual alpha gets forged. The warm Palm Beach sun, glisten of the Atlantic, and surprisingly decent (if overpriced) pulled pork sandwiches at the conference venue were nice, but it was spending time with the people of this industry that reaffirmed my conviction in Web3.I may have landed in Miami still with the bruised sheen of a first cycle degen, but I walked out something closer to a grizzled crypto lifer.Permissionless made me bullish again. 
Here are three reasons why:1. The Dewy Leaves of L2 SpringWandering the Palm Beach Convention Center, I was blown away by the sheer number of teams I met that are building on Ethereum L2s.Synthetix, Lyra Finance, Tracer DAO, Galleon DAO made up a big presence at the conference. Upgrades like Tracer’s Perpetual Pools V2 were rolled-out from the conference floor itself.On stage at Permissionless, Ethereum core devs Preston van Loon and Justin Drake signaled August as launch month for the long-awaited 2.0 Merge. 🤯**Check out Bankless’ previous piece on why the Merge is a game-changer.**The halls were also filled with growing support behind the L2-friendly EIP-4844— AKA danksharding.All this lead to one thing: L2 Spring.While the fabled L2 Summer' has yet to fully arrive, I think we are in the midst of an L2 Spring. The enthusiasm and quality of teams building out this new frontier is palpable and the dissipation of bull market noise has only increased their focus and drive, leaving me more excited than ever for the future of Ethereum scaling.2.

That’s because the ability to actively trade in IRS markets has historically been reserved for centralized institutions, not individual investors.If you’re new to these kinds of swaps — worry not! Once you learn the basics of IRS and make a few practice swaps on Voltz Protocol, you’ll have access to a massive range of DeFi strategies that are effective in both bull and bear markets. In this Tactic, we’ll cover the basics you need to know to get swapping.Not yet convinced of the importance of interest rate swaps in crypto?Let’s sketch out a basic trading scenario to show you what’s possible:If you believe that APYs on Lido stETH will increase in the future with The Merge, you can take that view with leverage on Voltz Protocol. In some cases, you can use over 300x leverage, turning a 1% increase in stETH rates into a 300% APY return! That’s an extremely risky example, but the returns are there to behold. 

Now, let’s talk about what interest rate swaps actually are. In their simplest form, interest rate swaps allow you to exchange one rate of return for another. This could mean exchanging a variable rate for a fixed rate, a fixed rate for a variable one or a variable rate for another variable rate.The best way to understand the basics of interest rate swaps is through examples.Two examples of interest rate swapsFirst off, let’s meet Alice, who will illustrate the value of variable-to-fixed swaps:Alice owns an asset with a variable rate of returnShe’s nervous about the rate going down in the futureInstead of holding on to that volatile variable rate, Alice swaps it for a fixed oneAlice now has peace of mind knowing her fixed rate won’t fluctuate 😌Alice is known as a Fixed Taker (FT)Why Alice would swap a volatile variable rate for a secure fixed rate is easy to understand, especially in crypto. But what about fixed-to-variable swaps?Let’s take a look:Bob owns an asset with a fixed rate of returnBased on market analysis, Bob thinks a variable rate could earn more than his fixed rateSince he has some tolerance for risk, Bob swaps his fixed rate for a variable oneIf the variable rate goes up, Bob could earn substantially more than he could with the fixed rate, but if it goes down, he risks losing moneyBob is known as a Variable Taker (VT)As you can see, FTs and VTs can have different levels of risk tolerance and different trading goals. Variable-to-variable swaps also exist but are a more advanced topic to explore in a future Tactic.One of the coolest things about interest rate swaps is that you don’t actually need to own an asset with a variable rate or an asset with a fixed rate to enter a swap. Instead, you just need to deposit enough margin to cover the potential interest rate payments that those assets would have.This means you can speculate as a Variable Taker without ever owning a fixed rate asset and speculate as a Fixed Taker without ever owning a variable rate asset.What is Voltz Protocol?Voltz Protocol is a noncustodial Automated Market Maker (AMM) that allows you to trade interest rate swaps with leverage.By utilizing DeFi advancements such as concentrated liquidity, Voltz Protocol is up to 3,000x more capital efficient than alternative IRS models that could be built, unlocking a wide range of trading and liquidity providing strategies.What does “capital efficiency” mean? Put simply, it means you can use less capital to generate returns, meaning the APYs have the potential to be much higher.Before we dive into a sample strategy that could earn you >100% APY in a bear market, let’s cover the fundamentals of the Voltz Protocol UI.First off, we’ll check in with Alice and Bob from our previous examples and walk through the Fixed Taker (FT) and Variable Taker (VT) flows alongside them.The FT and VT flowsThe time has come to load up the Voltz Protocol app!Ethereum Mainnet | Kovan Testnet 

Need testnet tokens? Head on over to faucet.paradigm.xyz to get some free fake ETH, then swap it for the desired tokens at  Kovan testnet UniswapOnce you connect your wallet, you’ll be brought to the trader screen, where you can see the pools that are currently available:For each pool, you’ll see the underlying yield-bearing asset, the current rates, and the maturity date. We’ll learn more about each of these categories while we use the app.Let’s click trade on our desired pool and see what happens!We can now decide what kind of swap we want to enter. Alice is up first with a Fixed Taker trade — she’s exchanging a variable rate in return for a fixed one. Therefore, we’ll choose the fixed option under rates.Now, we choose whether or not to leverage our position. Trading with leverage means we need to deposit less margin to cover our total trade size (notional). If we do not trade with leverage, the notional and margin amounts are equal. Trading with leverage involves the risk of being liquidated, so use it with care, but it also means your upside can be much higher.

Once you’ve input your desired margin, a trade information box will appear, showing you the breakdown of your swap:Hover over the trade information tooltip to find out more about each of these stats. Before entering the swap, you’ll be prompted to approve the pool and fee tokens (DAI in this example). If your position is fully collateralized (no leverage), you’ll also need to submit an approval for the protocol’s Full Collateralization Module (FCM).Now we’re ready to swap!Once the transaction has confirmed, you’ll see a summary page and a link to your portfolio:A 1:200 leveraged FT swap complete! The experience for Bob and other Variable Takers is even more straightforward than the FT flow. Return to the trader pools page from the traders dropdown and select the pool you’d like to use for a VT swap, then click variable and hold onto your seat!Input your desired notional and margin, click trade variable rate, and that’s it! You’ve now successfully entered a VT position.The Trader’s PortfolioThe trader’s portfolio page is where you can monitor your active interest rate swap positions.For each pool, you can click on tx history to see more details about the swaps you’ve entered. Be sure to keep track of the position health of your leveraged positions.If you see warning or danger, you may need to deposit more margin to avoid liquidation. The pool maturity date lets you know when you’ll be able to settle your position.LPing on Voltz ProtocolLiquidity Providers (LPs) supply the liquidity needed to trade interest rates on the Voltz Protocol AMM. LPs only need to provide a single asset to collect fees, which are maximized through a novel combination of concentrated liquidity, margin recycling and the margin engine — all of which can be read about in the Voltz Litepaper.To get started, navigate to the liquidity provider tab and click lp pools.Here, you’ll notice that there is a cap on the pools. This is in effect while the Voltz Protocol is in alpha state. Click provide liquidity on a pool that is not at capacity to continue.This module looks similar to the trading module, but with a couple key differences. The fixed rate low and fixed rate high sections refer to the tick ranges that liquidity providers need to specify when supplying concentrated liquidity. Read more about tick ranges in the Uniswap docs.Your LP PositionsAfter you’ve added your liquidity, you’ll see the positions page. You can navigate to this page anytime through the liquidity providers tab.Here, you’ll notice you have the ability to edit your LP positions. You can add margin to improve your position health, or withdraw the funds into your wallet. You can also add notional to increase the leverage of your position or burn it to lower your amount of leverage.>100% APY in a bear market?Now that you know how to use Voltz Protocol, you can start diving into IRS strategies and optimizing your returns — even in unfavorable market conditions. Feeling bullish on stETH rates going up? Open up a highly-leveraged VT position to turn even a small rate hike into a significant payoff. Looking to de-risk your portfolio? Lock in some fixed rates and rest easy.We’ll explore many different strategies in future Tactics, but for now, this alpha drink from Voltz Labs CEO Simon Jones will give us plenty reason to start swapping:Action stepsLearn about IRS swaps in TradFiRead 5 ways to earn fixed interest rates in DeFi",https://www.bankless.com/how-to-trade-interest-rates-with,2022-06-21T00:00:00.000Z,"https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/image/fetch/w_1200,h_600,c_limit,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https-3a-2f-2fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com-2fpublic-2fimages-2f6f1054be-f6e0-4d7a-a7ee-fadb26e00b63_2668x1501.jpg",Bankless,Bankless,blog,Unknown Error,

So while talks of “NFTs finally being dead” have been churning in mainstream circles in recent weeks, creatives and dreamers in our ecosystem simply continue to press on and do great work undeterred by all the noise. That said, I’m always on the hunt for interesting work around NFTs, and I’ve been exploring a handful of newer projects that are impressing me lately. Want to know what they are? Let’s walk through ‘em for today’s Metaversal ! -WMP New NFT projects to watch! 1) Archipelago What it is : Created by Art Blocks aficionados, Archipelago is an NFT marketplace that has been custom-tailored for all things generative art. The project’s been live for a little over a week at the time of this post’s writing, and in that short span the platform has already received many rave reviews for its elegant and unprecedented design elements. Why it matters : Other NFT marketplaces leave much to be desired when it comes to meeting the nuances of the ecosystem’s blossoming generative art scene. In specifically catering to the needs of generative art fans, Archipelago accordingly stands to become a considerable hub of activity in the NFT space in short order. 2) Astaria What it is : Spearheaded by former Sushi chief technical officer Joseph Delong, Astaria is an upcoming NFT lending protocol that will use a novel peer-to-pool approach and center around three types of stakeholders: appraisers, borrowers, and lenders. Why it matters : The NFT lending project scene has been swelling over the last year as projects have been racing to achieve product-market fit. There’s tons of demand in this arena and more than a few projects working on the problem already, but it doesn’t seem anyone has decisively “cracked the code” yet. Astaria’s unprecedented design may end up representing a leap forward for the space.","Dear Bankless Nation,If you scan around, there are some amazing upstart NFT projects that have been on the rise lately.So while talks of “NFTs finally being dead” have been churning in mainstream circles in recent weeks, creatives and dreamers in our ecosystem simply continue to press on and do great work undeterred by all the noise.That said, I’m always on the hunt for interesting work around NFTs, and I’ve been exploring a handful of newer projects that are impressing me lately.Want to know what they are?

Astaria’s unprecedented design may end up representing a leap forward for the space.3) BuenoWhat it is: Bueno is a suite of no-code tools for NFT creators, with the project’s first flagship product being its NFT Generator feature. This resource lets you upload art layers, e.g. from Photoshop, and then personally and simply customize the rules and rarities of your NFT collection. The project is also on the verge of releasing a no-code Smart Contract Deployer tool, so you can readily customize your art and deploy your NFT contract all from the Bueno hub.Why it matters: Bueno’s tools will make it vastly easier for non-technical creatives to deploy their own advanced NFT projects, which may help lead to the NFT ecosystem expanding considerably in the years ahead.4) ClubNFTWhat it is: ClubNFT is an NFT infrastructure project led by longtime cryptoart expert and creator Artnome, who has personally lost priceless NFTs over time due to early collections using private servers that have been lost forever. However, private servers are still in use by many contemporary NFT efforts! ClubNFT helps you check which of your NFTs face storage risks and back them up for posterity.Why it matters: People buy NFTs expecting that they can access them indefinitely. That’s why many folks are in for rude awakenings going forward if they don’t take proactive solutions now to backup their vulnerable NFTs. ClubNFT makes that process easy, and in turn the platform is poised to foster a resilient NFT ecosystem for years to come.5) SporesWhat it is: Spores is a music NFT remixer app built atop the Zora protocol. The project lets users remix music NFTs and then store these remixes as “Spores” on the IPFS data storage network.Why it matters: Sometimes lost in all the hubbub of web3 is whether decentralized apps are actually fun or not. And for me, Spores passed the fun test in a big way. I found myself playing with the project for over an hour the other day, just zoning out and enjoying my little music NFT DJing fest. I’d love to see more creative and delightful projects like this, and if Spores is an early indication, we’ll be seeing plenty more where that came from.Action steps🔥 Explore the Archipelago, Astaria, Bueno, ClubNFT, and Spores NFT projects👛 Check out my latest Bankless tactic, How to earn yield on your NFTs",https://www.bankless.com/5-cool-new-nft-projects-,2022-06-28T00:00:00.000Z,"https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/video/upload/e_loop,vs_40/xkq7xolcp4ahydnnbymr.gif",William M.

Run the DAO Like a Business DAOs aren’t magically immune from the laws of economics. They must take in more value than they expend. Corporate governance is a tried and true science. Just because it has the word “corporate” in the name doesn’t mean it’s evil or antithetical to what we’re doing here in DeFi. Good DAOs will apply the lessons of corporate governance structures to their own organization, while also being cognizant of the aspects that are meant to leave behind in TradFi. They will think critically about how to map corporate governance onto this new decentralized form factor: DAOs. And then they will execute on it. DeFi tokens that represent their respective DAOs will go up or down based on the value that flows into or out of the DAO. Sure, Uniswap...it’s great that you’re directing $9M every day in fees. So let’s start putting some of that into the DAO treasury and funding sustainable compensation for DAO growth. ‌                                                                       Upload Source ‌ $9M per day is ~$3.3B per year. If Uniswap charged just a 1% fee on its LPs, it would be earning $33M in yearly revenue for the DAO and its contributors, going from cash-flow negative to positive. However, this doesn’t just mean that DAOs need to turn on their fee switches. It also means they need to become far more judicial with their expenses. There’s no point in pouring water into a leaky bucket! All DAOs have a PnL (profit and loss ), and the health of that PnL needs to be considered! The profit mechanism is a market test of whether the product is of value to consumers. Without that test, we don’t know if it holds up against market forces. This is no longer 2021 where we could print billion-dollar treasuries whenever we feel like it. This is 2022. Interest rates are high , and money is tough. Won’t anyone consider the PnL? 😭","Dear Bankless Nation,A key catalyst of the 2021 bull market was linking DeFi protocols with governance.Via tokens, of course.Led by Compound and Uniswap, DeFi apps began issuing valueless governance tokens to their communities in order to decentralize power and give control over to the community.The idea of a community-driven financial system captured the imagination of the normies, the crypto curious, and even some crypto skeptics, to join in the fun of the 2021 bull market.But now the bull market is over, and the industry is realizing that valueless governance tokens are not the end-game.It’s the starting pistol.Today on the podcast, we release a crucially important episode, unpacking the state of DeFi tokens, DAO governance, and all the progress left to be made.Hasu, crypto-economic researcher and frontier explorer, returns to the show to help unpack the deficiencies that DAOs have, why they exist, and what we need to do about them.On Bankless, we’ll make a particular podcast for any variety of reasons; it’s good info, philosophically relevant, or just good entertainment.But this episode is none of that. This episode (I hope) marks a turning point for DAOs, to turn their useless governance tokens into powerful drivers of value-capture, sustainable compensation for contributors, and meaningful growth of the organization.Perhaps one day, DAOs can join in on buying the naming rights to big sports stadiums…but first, they must fix their relationship with their token.Here are the 5 steps that DAOs need to take in that direction.1. Run the DAO Like a BusinessDAOs aren’t magically immune from the laws of economics.They must take in more value than they expend.Corporate governance is a tried and true science. Just because it has the word “corporate” in the name doesn’t mean it’s evil or antithetical to what we’re doing here in DeFi.Good DAOs will apply the lessons of corporate governance structures to their own organization, while also being cognizant of the aspects that are meant to leave behind in TradFi. They will think critically about how to map corporate governance onto this new decentralized form factor: DAOs.And then they will execute on it.DeFi tokens that represent their respective DAOs will go up or down based on the value that flows into or out of the DAO.Sure, Uniswap...it’s great that you’re directing $9M every day in fees.So let’s start putting some of that into the DAO treasury and funding sustainable compensation for DAO growth.‌                                                                       UploadSource‌$9M per day is ~$3.3B per year. If Uniswap charged just a 1% fee on its LPs, it would be earning $33M in yearly revenue for the DAO and its contributors, going from cash-flow negative to positive.However, this doesn’t just mean that DAOs need to turn on their fee switches. It also means they need to become far more judicial with their expenses. There’s no point in pouring water into a leaky bucket!All DAOs have a PnL (profit and loss), and the health of that PnL needs to be considered! The profit mechanism is a market test of whether the product is of value to consumers. Without that test, we don’t know if it holds up against market forces.This is no longer 2021 where we could print billion-dollar treasuries whenever we feel like it.This is 2022. Interest rates are high, and money is tough.Won’t anyone consider the PnL? 😭2. Define a ConstitutionAll DAOs need to write a constitution.This constitution should instantiate the purpose and vision of the DAO. It should codify the core values and high-level strategy of the organization. It should be used as a document to refer back to and reference when making decisions in the DAO.Having a clearly defined constitution for what a DAO is, what it’s here to do, and how it’s going to do it will help eliminate redundant and unhelpful conversations in DAO discourse.If the members of a DAO cannot agree on what its mission is, then different parties in a DAO will engage in rent-seeking efforts to try and pull in the direction that they see as best. These efforts will often be antagonistic to other parts of the DAO and therefore will soon come into conflict, rather than working towards a common vision.Organizations need to move together, as a unit!But without a defined goal, no one knows where we’re going!Blindly into the night they go, funding random things along the way.3. Stop Having Global Token VotesGovernance decisions impart a huge cost to the DAO.Every time there is a governance decision, it’s crucial that the DAO carefully consider it, in order to produce the correct outcome. Good business management means making good business decisions!DAOs should optimize for having 100% hit rates on making the correct decision.The easiest way to do this? Make fewer decisions - especially only on the ones that matter.Each decision should be carefully considered, analyzed, and debated. Therefore, the kinds of decisions that go to a global token vote need to be only the most crucial ones; ones that cannot be decided alone by smaller sub-components of the DAO.Global token votes are only for decisions that affect the DAO in its entirety.Global token votes should be considered the “Supreme Court of the DAO”. Good DAO decision-making processes should have 99% of decisions decided upon before being elevated to the highest level of DAO decision-making.SubDAOs are critical for this. The engineering department doesn’t make marketing decisions, and marketing doesn’t make product decisions.SubDAOs need to be enabled to make decisions independently, without having to ask the broader DAO for permission. Any organization that forces all departments to ask for permission to do things is simply NGMI.Asking for forgiveness runs circles around asking for permission.A simple addition to this makes this very crypto-economically awesome: All subDAO decisions can be vetoed by a global token vote. This gives the entire organization the power to say no to an errant subDAO decision but doesn’t require the organization to be analyzing every single decision of every single corner of the DAO.Remember: when people are making governance decisions, they’re not doing work.The goal is to do work.4. Stop Paying For LiquidityJust stop the yield farming.You shouldn’t pay for liquidity, you should earn it.Liquidity incentives are a bull market thing. They’re not sustainable. The reasons why a team might start up liquidity incentives are twofold:To distribute tokens to the market, and decentralize power away from foundersTo boost liquidity, so they can dump their supply and get their “exit”Both of these violate the first bit of advice above: “Run the DAO like a business”.Many DAOs or DeFi apps are still—to this day—paying for liquidity… for no reason.It’s destroying the cap table and draining the treasuries of these organizations, and the outcome is that the actual decision makers of a DAO become smaller proportional holders of the respective governance token. This discourages them from having the incentive to operate the DAO in the first place, and even if they wanted to stick around and lead the DAO, they have a much smaller say in its governance.All because the DAO paid a bunch of misaligned yield farmers a bunch of money who sold that token for ETH.Stop paying for liquidity.5. Turn on Fees and Fund DAO OperationsPeople have been clamoring for Uniswap to “turn on the fee switch!!!” so that UNI can be a dividend-paying token.Not so fast, fam. High-growth companies don’t pay dividends to investors; they invest profits back into the company.Let’s turn on the fee switch just enough to pay for the operations of the DAO.This will do a few things:Show the world that the fee switch is on 🎉Produce a positive PnL for DAO operationsCompensate DAO contributors for work, and encourage further contributionEven without paying fees directly to token holders, I promise you it will change the momentum.DeFi tokens don’t need to pay their holders money. They just need to produce a compelling story behind the investment thesis of the token.If the governance token is governing over an effective organization with a positive PnL and that effective organization is growing in scale, that is plenty sufficient to encourage some meaningful bids on the token.SEC’s Fault?A lot of the broken nature of DAOs is due to the SEC.Liquidity incentives were a downstream effect of needing to distribute tokens away from the founders and to the community. But sadly, you can’t just expect to give tokens to the community and expect them to become DAO workers.They’ve probably already got jobs.But the founders can’t keep the tokens, because they need the token to not be a security, lest it falls astray from U.S. securities laws.DAOs have been hyperfocused on “decentralizing decision making”.That’s nice, but it has also meant accumulating unnecessary inefficiencies.How do we fix this unfortunate position?First, the SEC should get its sh*t together and allow for a regulatory sandbox in the DeFi/DAO space.But barring that, one path forwards is to simply compensate leadership for the risk.If DAO leaders are worried about the risks that come associated with being in a DAO leadership position, then the DAO simply needs to pay them more, so that they’re worried and wealthy, instead of just worried.Legal costs need to be accounted for and budgeted.But mainly, the SEC needs to get its sh*t together.Watch the episode with Hasu for a full deep dive into this topic.

There are numerous other ways for investors willing to go out on the risk-curve to gain exposure.Let’s explore four different ways in which investors can capitalize on the Merge.1️. Liquid Staking Tokens👉 Examples: LDO, RPL, SWISELiquid staking services are the most direct beneficiaries of the Merge, with the non-custodial protocols likely to experience significant growth in the months following the transition to PoS.The value proposition of liquid staking is straightforward — It allows users to do all three of the following at once: Maintain custody of their collateral, earn a staking reward, and deploy their assets within DeFi through the issuance of a liquid staking derivative (LSD).The Merge will dramatically accelerate the growth of these protocols as it will de-risk staking by removing the pre-Merge technical and execution risk.In addition, a completed Merge and a clearer timeline for withdrawals will also help reduce the discount that LSDs trade at relative to ETH. Lido’s stETH is currently valued at ~0.963 ETH, but when I wrote about Celsius’ implosion in June, recall that the stETH:ETH parity depegged as hard as ~0.933 ETH.True—Beacon Chain withdrawals will not be enabled until the Shanghai network upgrade, expected to be ~6-12 months post-Merge. But the magnitude of the Merge will drive a decrease in this discount, making staking with these protocols more attractive as it implies depositors are taking on less price risk.Furthermore, liquid staking protocols are likely to grow deposits due to the projected increase in staking yields. Today, Beacon Chain validators solely earn block rewards. Post-Merge, stakers will be able to earn transaction fees and revenue from MEV. This is projected to dramatically increase the staking yield from roughly ~4%, where it sits today, to anywhere from 6-12%.These growth drivers should also lead to increased revenues for liquid staking protocols, as deposits, higher yields, and a potentially higher ETH-price (the asset in which their revenue is denominated) will bolster their top-line.There are currently three liquid staking protocols with publicly traded tokens: Lido (LDO), Rocket Pool (RPL), and Stakewise (SWISE).Each token can play a different role within a portfolio:Investors looking for blue-chip exposure may want to take a look at LDO, as it is the largest entity staking on the Beacon Chain with a 31.2% share of deposits. Lido has an even greater hold over the liquid staking sector with a 90.3% market share within this niche. The token currently trades with a market cap of $1.48B and FDV of $2.70B.Tokenomics-oriented investors may look to Rocket Pool’s RPL, the second largest liquid staking protocol with a 1.6% share of Beacon Chain deposits and a 4.5% share in the liquid staking sector that has a MC of $467.52M and FDV of $519.73M. RPL has unique tokenomics in that minipool operators, or entities validating via Rocket Pool, are required to purchase 1.6 ETH worth of RPL for each new validator they spin up, which ties demand for the token to growth for RPL. This ties demand for the token to growth.Investors wanting to maximize risk and optimize for beta can look to StakeWise (SWISE), which trades at a MC of $26.66M and FDV of $198.45M. While the protocol has just a 0.4% and 1.3% share of Beacon Chain and liquid staking deposits respectively, it is likely to be the highest beta token among the three due to its smaller size and low float.2️. Event-Based DeFi BetsBuying tokens is not the only way to get exposure to the Merge. Savvy market participants can leverage DeFi in a variety of different ways to “trade the narrative” and express their views on how different markets will react to it before, during, and after.One way in which a user can do this is by lending ETH on money markets like Aave, Compound, and Euler. Why? There will likely be a considerable increase in demand to borrow ETH around the time of the Merge, as investors will want to accumulate as much of the asset as possible in order to farm the “airdrop” from a potential PoW-based Ethereum fork (ETHPOW).As interest rates on these protocols are based on utilization (i.e., how much of the asset is borrowed), a major spike in borrowing demand would lead to incredibly high deposit rates for lenders. The interest rate curve for ETH on Aave V2 begins to “kink” or accelerate rapidly at 70% utilization. With this market currently at 61.56% utilization, and having spiked considerably since August 8, it is certainly possible that this scenario unfolds.Source: Aave docsOf course, this strategy is not without risk. In an extreme scenario where there are incredibly high borrowing demand, meaning there is little ETH liquid in Aave, lenders may be temporarily unable to withdraw the asset until borrowers repay or more deposits flood into the protocol.A second way to use DeFi to express a view on Merge-related events is to use Voltz Protocol, an AMM for interest-rate swaps to bet on the LSD staking yields.Since returns from staking are likely to increase post-Merge, market participants can use Voltz to express this view by posting ETH as margin and purchase variable rate stETH or rETH tokens (which are issued synthetically). Users can magnify their returns by utilizing leverage, though this of course introduces considerably more risk as it opens them up to the risk of liquidation. Please be careful when using leverage of any kind!👉 To read more about how to use Voltz to trade the Merge, click here.3️. PoW Airdrop FarmingThere are billions at stake in the mining industry, and as Lucas wrote earlier this week, it is a near certainty that some PoW instantiation of Ethereum will exist post-Merge. Numerous high-profile industry figures, such as Justin Sun and his exchange, Poloniex, have already pledged to support this hard fork and plan to list the ETHPOW token.While it is unclear if this chain will have any long-term viability, or how much value ETHPOW will have, users can still put themselves in a position to earn the seemingly inevitable airdrop in multiple different ways.The simplest way to qualify for this airdrop is to hold ETH in a non-custodial wallet (Metamask, Coinbase Wallet, etc.).But if you’re looking for higher-risk opportunities, one way is to take the other side of the bet by borrowing ETH on a money market, which can be profitable if the value of the airdrop is greater than the cost of borrowing ETH. This strategy comes with considerable risk though. Not only may borrow rates exceed any earnings from the airdrop, but borrowers also stand to be liquidated should the price of ETH soar, or their collateral fall in value. Given the high likelihood of massive volatility on the day of the Merge, investors will need to proceed very carefully.Another way investors can farm the airdrop without taking on any price risk is to create a delta-neutral ETH position using perpetual futures. To do this, a user would purchase spot ETH while shorting an equivalent amount of ETH using perps on a CEX or DEX. This way, users are exposed to ETH, so they can earn the airdrop, while not taking on the price risk that comes with holding the asset. This strategy will be profitable if the value of the airdrop exceeds funding (the cost of keeping open a perps position).However, there is no such thing as a free lunch. This strategy is significantly risky, as funding, like borrow rates may skyrocket with the Merge approaches. Any kind of leveraged strategies like these, coupled with the volatility will put users at outsized risk of being liquidated.Proceed with caution!4️. Follow-On BeneficiariesFinally, a post-Merge Ethereum is poised to have a transformative impact on other sectors of the Ethereum economy.One of these beneficiaries are Layer-2s (L2), as the transition to PoS will pave the way for scalability upgrades (e.g. EIP-4844) which will dramatically reduce transaction fees for end-users on rollups by decreasing the cost of storing call data on-chain. This fee reduction should serve to catalyze L2 adoption by increasing the number of users that can transact on the network and unlocking the capability to build new, novel dapps.Investors can (and already have begun) capitalize on this by investing throughout the L2 ecosystem, such as on the L2 base layer (OP), or L2-native DeFi primitives like Synthetix (SNX) and GMX (GMX), or smaller-caps projects native to different ecosystems. Don’t forget about supporting L2 infrastructure like fast-bridging services such as Synapse (SYN) and Hop Protocol (HOP).Another industry that is set to change after the Merge is MEV. The competitive dynamics of MEV are set to change drastically following the implementation of proposer-builder separation which will separate the production of blocks (deciding what transactions go in one) from the validation of blocks. David eloquently outlined this yesterday in The Ethereum Watershed.There are numerous projects within the MEV stack with publicly traded tokens that could provide a way to gain exposure to this shift, such as Manifold Finance (FOLD) Rook Protocol (ROOK), and Cow Protocol (COW).While many of these tokens have run considerably in recent weeks, they are still poised to be long-term beneficiaries of a PoS Ethereum.Conclusion: Choose Your Own AdventureThe Merge is fast approaching, and promises to bring with it significant changes to the Etheruem economy, as well as shorter-term chaos on-chain.The safest way to gain exposure is to simply buy ETH.But this is no longer the 2018 bear market and we live in a DeFi world, so there are numerous other ways in which investors can play the Merge, whether it be through investing/trading in liquid staking protocols and long-term Merge beneficiaries in the L2 and MEV sectors, or by using DeFi to earn yield or farm the ETHPOW airdrop.How will you gain exposure, anon?Action steps📚 Read David’s The Ethereum Watershed yesterday if you missed it",https://www.bankless.com/ethereum-merge-investing-strategy-eth,2022-08-11T00:00:00.000Z,"https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/image/fetch/w_1200,h_600,c_limit,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https-3a-2f-2fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com-2fpublic-2fimages-2f1fb43dbe-564d-4c04-a2f9-911540de53e7_2668x1501.jpg",Ben Giove,Bankless,blog,Unknown Error,

Despite this, the core thesis remains, Ethereum is set to undergo the largest structural shift in the history of crypto. Back in January, the path to the Merge was extremely uncertain. Now, that path has crystalized.The final testnet, Goerli, was recently completed successfully and a Mainnet target date has been set for Sep 15/16.So where do we stand?The Biggest Structural Shift in Crypto HistoryRegarding the Merge the thesis has not changed, Ethereum is set to undergo a massive structural shift as expenses will effectively be reduced to zero.The shift will give rise to the first large-scale structural demand asset in crypto history. As we have stated in our core thesis many times, this paper will address what has changed and new topics not discussed in the prior article. First, it is useful to highlight aspects of the core Ethereum model to get a sense of some of the key fundamentals such as supply reduction and the post-Merge staking rate.The largest shift since last December is that ETH-denominated fees have fallen significantly. However, there is an interesting dynamic at play here. Although fees have declined, active users have experienced a steady uptrend since late June.This may seem inconsistent as more users should lead to higher gas. However, we believe this dynamic is caused by recent efficiency optimizations of various popular Ethereum applications. The best and most significant example is Opensea, which in migrating Seaport (from Wyvern) increased gas efficiency by 35%. This has led to a reduction in gas that doesn’t correlate to a decline in activity.In fact, multiple indicators suggest that despite the low gas readings activity has been increasing recently (more on the specifics here later). This raises an interesting question: what is the optimal fee run rate for Ethereum? Higher fees mean more ETH is burned and post-Merge also correlates to a higher staking rate, but these higher fees also limit adoption.As we saw in ’21, when fees are too high, some users get pushed to other L1 ecosystems. After roll-ups scale appropriately, Ethereum should be able to achieve both high fees and continued adoption. In the current environment though, it is interesting to think about the optimal mix. We believe the optimal point is approximately the point at which fees are high enough to burn all new issuance. This will enable ETH supply to be stable while also keeping fees low enough not to inhibit adoption. Interestingly, of late, fees have found an equilibrium near this point. Lower fees also seem to be having a positive impact on adoption as active users have begun to increase after a long downtrend.Despite the fact that we seem to be near an optimal fee run rate, the reduced fees do negatively impact various model outputs. This impact is not critical as at the current run rate the burn would still be still large enough for ETH to be slightly deflationary post-Merge. Importantly, the current run rate would continue to drive structural demand as the majority of issuance is unlikely to be sold, while fees that are used must be purchased off the open market.The staking rate will increase post-Merge by ~100 bps from 4.2% to 5.2%. However, this does not properly illustrate the true impact. To fully appreciate the shift, we must evaluate the real yield rather than the nominal yield. While the current nominal yield is ~4.2%, the real yield is close to zero, as 4.4% of new ETH is issued every year. In this context, the real yield is currently ~0% but will increase to ~5% post-Merge. This is an enormous shift and will create the highest real yield in crypto by a large margin. The only other comparable yield is BNB with a 1% real yield. ETH’s 5% yield will be a market-leading figure. What is the significance of this yield?Stakers will receive a net ~5% rate, which equates to 100/5= ~20x earnings. This multiple is considerably cheaper than the revenue multiple because the staking participation rate is quite low, meaning stakers receive an outsized share of total rewards. This is one of the key advantages of ETH from an investment standpoint.As there are so many other uses for ETH, throughout the crypto ecosystem, most ETH ends up locked in those applications rather than staked. This in turn allows stakers to receive an outsized real yield.In terms of the flows, ETH will transition from enduring structural outflows of ~$18mm/day to structural inflows of ~$0.3mm/day. While the demand side of the flow equation has softened, the complete reduction of the supply side remains the most important variable. Our estimate for the ETH-denominated supply reduction is actually larger than it was previously. This is due to the fact that the price declines from the highs have not been accompanied by a corresponding hash rate reduction. As a result, miner profitability has decreased dramatically, and they are likely selling close to 100% of mined ETH.For calculation’s sake, I have assumed 80% of miner issuance is being sold. In this context, ETH has found an equilibrium in which miners sell roughly 10.8k ETH ($18mm USD) per day. Given that fees have been averaging ~$2mm this yields a net outflow of ~$16mm. Post Merge this sell pressure will reduce to zero, and it is projected that there will be a structural inflow of ~$0.3mm/day post-Merge.To conclude, while many of the numbers have shifted meaningfully in the last eight months, the conclusion remains roughly the same, ETH will shift from requiring ~$18mm of new money entering the asset to keep the price from declining to requiring ~$0.3mm exiting to keep the price from increasing.To summarize, the staking rate and structural demand are lower than they were 6 months ago. However, this is to be expected in a period of slower activity, and if activity continues to rebound these rates will increase. The primary investment case remains the same, there is an enormous opportunity to front-run the largest structural shift in the history of crypto.Another point that I think is often overlooked here is that the Merge is more than a shift in supply and demand. It is also a massive fundamental upgrade for Ethereum as the network becomes much more efficient and secure in many ways. This is part of what differentiates the Merge from prior BTC halvings.It is 3x as large of a supply reduction combined with a massive improvement in fundamentals compared to a decline in fundamentals in the case of BTC halvings (reduced security).Finally, there are two additional dynamics worth discussing.1. Time HarvestingBefore addressing how this relates to ETH it is important to lay some contextual groundwork.Why is it that the SPX (or virtually any US/Global equity index) has been such a profitable and consistent investment vehicle over the long term? Most people think this dynamic has been driven almost entirely by earnings growth and multiple expansion. They would posit that if growth slows or the multiple stops expanding these investments would be unlikely to have positive returns going forward. This is incorrect.The primary and most reliable source of growth for the price of these indices has been the passage of time.Here is an example to illustrate this somewhat unintuitive point. A lemonade stand, LEMON (LEMON = The Enterprise, $LEMON = LEMON shares), earns $1 each year. There are 10 shares of $LEMON outstanding. LEMON has no cash or debt on its balance sheet. The market currently values $1 of ex-growth equity earnings at a 10x multiple. What is LEMON worth today? What about each share of $LEMON?If we assume that next year LEMON will continue to earn $1 annually while the market applies the same multiple, what will LEMON/$LEMON be worth in a year? Take a minute and come to an answer.If you answered $10/$1 for the first pair of questions you are correct. If you answered $10/$1 for the second pair, you are not. For part 1, LEMON is worth $10 as the market applies a 10x multiple to its $1 of earnings and assigns 0 value to its balance sheet. For part 2, the market continues to apply a 10x multiple to the $1 of earnings, but importantly, it also assigns $1 to the $1 of cash that now sits on LEMON’s balance sheet. LEMON is now worth $11 and each share is worth $1.10. When companies earn money, the money doesn’t disappear, it flows to the company’s balance sheet and the value of it accrues to the owners of the business (the equity holders). $LEMON has appreciated 10% in a year due to the earnings they have generated, despite 0 growth and 0 multiple expansion.This is the power of earnings yield paired with the passage of time.Crypto hasn’t benefited from this dynamic at all. In fact, crypto actually suffers from the reverse effect. Since almost all crypto projects’ expenses are greater than their revenues, they must dilute their holders to generate the funds necessary to cover their negative net income. As a result, unless earnings grow or their multiple expands, the price of each individual token will decline. The most notable exception I can think of is BNB, which is the sole current L1 to generate more revenue than expenses.It is no surprise the chart of BNB/BTC is essentially up only and recently broke an ATH.ETH will enter this exclusive class the moment it transitions to PoS. Post-merge ETH will generate a real yield of approximately 5%. This yield will be very different from virtually every other (non-BNB) L1 where the staking yield simply comes from inflation that offsets the yield. All else equal ETH holders will earn 5% each year. Time will become a tailwind rather than the headwind it is for 99.9% of other projects.This will also change the psychology of holders and incentivize a stronger long-term buy and hold approach, effectively locking up more illiquid supply. Additionally, the “real yield” thesis and the fact that ETH will be the first large-scale real yield crypto asset will be particularly appealing to many institutions and should help accelerate institutional adoption.2. The Wall of WorryThroughout the last few months, investors have been extremely skeptical about technical risks, edge cases, and timing risks.The latest edge case that has generated attention is the potential for PoW forks of Ethereum that live on after the Merge. Some PoW maximalists (miners etc.) would prefer to use PoW ETH and think that a forked version of the current ETH is superior to ETC, which already exists as a PoW alternative. We do not believe there is much value in the fork, but our opinion on this matter is not particularly relevant.The important point is that this fork will have no impact on post-Merge PoS ETH. All of the potential risks are either easily managed or not risks in the first place. For example, replay attacks will most probably not be an issue as the PoW chain is unlikely to use the same chain ID. Furthermore, even if they maliciously choose to use the same chain ID, this can be managed by either not interacting with the PoW chain or first sending the assets to a splitter contract.Finally, even if a user does get replay attacked, it will only impact that individual user’s assets and not the overall health of the chain. What the PoW fork does do is provide a dividend to ETH holders, further adding to the value of the Merge. If the fork has any value, ETH holders will be able to send it to an exchange and sell it for additional capital, much of which will then be recycled back into PoS ETH. While we view this as a positive for the Merge-related investment case, many are worried about the potential risks and a litany of other edge cases. We have weighed each risk and concluded the upside far outweighs the downside.Nonetheless, these concerns are keeping many long-term believers sidelined.As we approach the Merge many of these issues will be addressed. Eventually, many of these skeptics will be converted, creating fueling continued inflows as we approach the event and culminating with a large set of buyers who will purchase ETH the day the Merge occurs successfully. This should help offset any “sell the news” dynamic.Just last month, less than 1/3 of people thought the Merge would occur before October. Now the date has been confirmed for mid-September and still, the market is only pricing in two-thirds chance of it occurring before October.Given this backdrop how should we expect prices to move as we approach the Merge? This is the central question.First, we acknowledge the reality that macro will continue to have a large impact on absolute price levels despite the Merge. However, it is still reasonable to think through how Merge related alpha will evolve over the coming weeks. In our opinion, the path gets harder to predict the further out you look but then at some point when you’ve gone far enough it starts to become easier again.Short-TermDespite the narrative that has already been building around the Merge, positioning is still quite light within the more discretionary pockets of the market. Perpetual funding has remained negative for most of the rally since June, indicating that there are more shorts than longs in the perp market.Recently, Bitfinex longs, another notable discretionary pocket of ETH exposure, were reduced back to the lows.IMO, this light positioning is likely due to many larger participants viewing this move as a “bear market rally” and therefore wanting to put hedges on as we have continued higher.Historically, there is a large contingent of investors, who lean in the direction of BTC maximalism and will always look to fade the Merge narrative. Their theses primarily revolve around one of two central points.The first is: “the Merge has been 6 months away for 6 years.” The second concern is around technical/execution risk. After evaluating the timing and execution risk, we have become comfortable with both. After the final testnet, Goerli, was successfully Merged earlier this week, the core developers set a target for the Mainnet Merge for September 15/16. All that remains is coordination.While many are concerned about the execution risk, the upgrade has been tested extremely rigorously over the years and cross-checked by many teams. Furthermore, one of the core pillars of Ethereum is resilience. This is the reason there are so many different clients–the redundancy acts as a safety net to protect against singular edge cases or bugs. Multiple, usually well over two, unrelated fluke events occurring simultaneously would be required to affect the protocol.This built-in resilience, the most accomplished developer team in the space, and many years of preparation have given us comfort that a technical issue, though a risk, is unlikely.Given the cautious positioning and constant desire to “fade” the trade, I expect the next four weeks to follow a similar path as the prior four. There will be periods of pronounced fear as people overanalyze extremely unlikely edge cases. However, I expect the price declines around these periods to be shallow as there are many underexposed parties looking to add exposure on any weakness. Furthermore, almost everyone selling ETH over these next few weeks is only selling it tactically and planning to buy it back at some point before, or immediately after the Merge occurs.This dynamic means net outflows are measured. On the flip side, I expect the hype around the Merge to magnify significantly as the date comes into focus and the narrative is picked up by the mainstream media. As I believe the thesis is extremely compelling and digestible by both institutional and retail capital, I expect inflows to accelerate as we approach the Merge creating a higher high, higher low dynamic as we approach the date.What happens once the Merge actually occurs? Normally, you would think there would be risk of a “sell the news” reaction; many investors concerned about technical risk, plan to buy post-Merge. They believe they will capture the structural effect of the Merge without the technical risks. The post-Merge period will also depend on how much FOMO is generated as we approach the Merge and positioning when we actually get there.We do expect significant buy flows and follow-through directly after the Merge as it is effectively “de-risked.”Medium-TermWe expect a period of range trading as short-term traders sell, and this sell flow will be digested by the structural demand and larger slower moving institutional accounts. Price action in this period is less predictable and depends on the macro environment. As I have said previously, macro is incredibly hard to predict, but I will offer a few thoughts, nonetheless.The crypto macro environment is driven by one core metric: whether adoption is growing, stable, or declining. This metric is somewhat impacted by the broader macro environment, but ultimately what matters most is this adoption metric. The reason this metric affects prices is because adoption also drives the long-term flow of funds into or out of the space. Simply put, when users are adopting crypto, they are generally also investing new money into the crypto ecosystem, and this is what drives the macro. When adoption is declining macro is hostile, when it is flat, macro is neutral and when it is growing, macro is accommodating. So how does the macro look today?For the majority of the last 8-9 months, we have been in a declining adoption environment with a net outflow of users departing the ecosystem.From May ’21 until the end of June daily active users have experienced a declining trend. Over the last ~6 weeks, we have seen a nascent recovery as users have steadily been increasing. This is a green shoot and indicates a potential thawing of the macro environment. We had been in a declining adoption phase, and we have now, at least, entered a stable adoption phase and potentially an increasing adoption phase. There are other green shoots that have been sprouting recently as well.After many weeks of redemptions, Tether has started to slowly mint new coins. After a long period of outflows, new money has started to enter the space again.This impact is not unique to the Ethereum ecosystem, AVAX has also recently seen daily active users increase.NFT users and transactions have been stable recentlyAnd certain web searches have started to positively inflect, while others are more stable.These are not dramatic increases, nothing like the exponential increases we saw at the start of the ’21 bull market. This is why I label them green shoots. They are still young and fragile. If they are smothered, they will likely wither and die, but if nurtured they could grow into something material.We think the broader macro environment will play a key role in determining whether these green shoots live or die. To us, inflation is by far the most important macroeconomic variable; therefore, we believe that if inflation moderates and allows the fed to pivot and ease monetary policy there is a good chance these green shoots will grow stronger. However, if inflation remains high and the fed is forced to continue tightening policy they will likely be smothered and die. Predicting the course of inflation is not our primary domain, however, due to its significance in markets today, we studied it closely. After review, we feel moderating inflation is the most likely outcome, which should give these green shoots a chance to blossom.Another advantage, in favor of a more sustained bottom, is the fact that an enormous amount of vesting from project launches in the last 24 months has now been absorbed. Furthermore, as most of the projects are down 70-95%, the USD notional size of all future vesting is also vastly reduced. Together, these two dynamics help meaningfully reduce the overall daily supply the space must absorb.Lastly, the final variable that we think will impact this equation is none other than the Merge. Investors underestimate the impact the Merge will have on the macro environment of the entire space. There is some uncertainty about how much the supply reduction caused by prior BTC halvings has fueled the ensuing price action rather than coincidentally aligning with the natural cycles of human emotion and monetary policy.  We sympathize with these uncertainties and think there has been an element of luck in the timing. However, we think the supply reductions also had an impact and the truth likely lies somewhere in the middle. Another common criticism is that supply changes don’t drive price and all that matters are demand changes. We are not in accord with this thinking. A supply reduction is not different than a demand addition.Let’s say miners sell 10k ETH/day, and instead of getting rid of this sell pressure we simply add 10k ETH/day of buy pressure. This would have the exact same impact as eliminating the miners’ sell pressure but would be a demand change rather than a supply change. It is obvious these two options would have the same impact and it, therefore, makes no sense to us why one would matter more than another.If we then believe that BTC halvings have impacted crypto’s macro, then it stands to reason that the Merge should do the same. While ETH dominance is significantly lower than BTC dominance at the time of the last halving, the impact from the Merge is nearly as large as the prior BTC halving as a % of total crypto market cap and significantly larger on an absolute basis.Post-Merge crypto will be relieved of ~$16mm of daily supply. This is not an insignificant amount. To recognize this, it is useful to consider the cumulative impact.We think a TWAP of 70k ETH per week would have a market impact. That is effectively the impact the Merge will have except it doesn’t stop after a year; it continues into perpetuity. This has the potential to positively influence the entire space as the positive flow impact trickles into other parts of the market. This should provide an added macro tailwind to help nurture the green shoots we referenced earlier and increases their odds of survival.To conclude, if macro moderates at all, there is a real chance that what began as a bounce off of a capitulation bottom morphs into a more sustainable and organic recovery and the Merge should help aid this process.Long-TermIn the long-term, the future becomes easier to predict, as structural flows are most important over this time horizon and easier to forecast. This is where the Merge’s impact is most pronounced. As long as Ethereum’s network adoption continues, which we deem likely, structural demand will remain and further inflows will also exist. This should result in sustainable and consistent appreciation, especially compared to other tokens, over many years (hopefully decades) to come. We expect Ethereum to surpass Bitcoin as the largest cryptocurrency within the next few years as we believe flows are the most important variable in crypto. Ethereum will forever have a flow tailwind post-Merge. Bitcoin will forever have a flow headwind. To get a sense for how things may look, the BNB/BTC chart is a good place to start.BNB/BTC has steadily increased and made multiple new ATHs during this bear market despite little narrative momentum. We believe this is primarily due to the fact that BNB is the only L1 with structural demand. Post-Merge Ethereum will have greater structural demand than BNB both on an absolute and market cap weighted basis.Investment Strategies to Win the Merge1. ETH/BTCBefore evaluating the ETH/BTC trade it is necessary to provide some more general context on the PoW vs PoS debate. Much of the following is paraphrased from the appendix of the first article but it is worth reiterating. We believe PoS is a fundamentally more secure system for a variety of reasons. Firstly, each unit of security costs less with PoS. To understand why PoS provides more efficient security than PoW we first need to explore how these consensus mechanisms generate security in the first place. A consensus mechanism is as secure as the cost to 51% attack it. The efficiency of the system can then be measured by the cost (issuance) required to generate a unit amount of security.In other words, how many dollars the network has to pay out to receive $1 of protection from a 51% attack. For PoW, the cost of a 51% attack is primarily the hardware required to obtain 51% of the hash rate. The relevant metric is how much money miners require to invest $1 in mining hardware. The math tends to work out close to 1 to 1 meaning miners require 100% annual rate of return on their investment or in other words $1 of annual issuance for each $1 they spend on hardware and utilities. In this context, the network needs to issue roughly $1 of supply each year to generate $1 of security.In the case of PoS, stakers are not required to purchase hardware, so the question becomes what return do stakers demand to lock up their stake in the PoS consensus mechanism?In general, stakers require a significantly lower rate of return than the 100% miners typically demand.The primary reason for this is that there is no incremental cost outlay and their assets do not depreciate (mining hardware typically depreciates close to 0 after a few years). The required rate should generally fall in the 3-10% range. As we calculated earlier, the current estimated post-Merge staking rate of 5% falls right in the middle of this range. This means that to gain $1 of security a PoS needs to issue $0.03-$0.10 of issuance. This is 10x-33x more efficient than PoW (20x more in the case of Ethereum’s PoS).To conclude, this means that a PoS network can issue ~1/20th the issuance of a PoW network and be just as secure. In the case of ETH, they will actually issue about 1/10th of the issuance and the network will be twice as secure as it was during PoW.This efficiency is not the only advantage. Both consensus mechanisms share a common issue, which is that the security of the chain is correlated to the price of the token. This has the potential to create a self-reinforcing negative feedback loop whereby the reduction in token price causes a reduction in security, which therefore causes a decrease in confidence and drives a further decrease in token price and then repeats. PoS has a natural defense against this dynamic, PoW doesn’t. The attack vector for PoS is much more secure than PoW.First, to attack a PoS system you must control a majority of the stake. To do this you must purchase at least as many tokens as are staked from the market. However, not all tokens are available for sale. In fact, much of the supply is never traded and is effectively illiquid. Furthermore, and most importantly, with each token acquired the next token becomes harder and more expensive to acquire.In the case of Ethereum, only ~1/3 of tokens are liquid (moved in the last 90 days). This means that once a steady state staking participation rate of closer to 30% has been reached it will be extremely difficult no matter the amount of money possessed, to attack the network. An attacker would need to purchase the entire liquid supply, which is impractical and nearly impossible.Another important feature of this defense mechanism is that it is relatively unaffected by price. Because the limiting factor to attack is liquid supply rather than money it does not get much easier to attack the network with lower prices. If there is not enough liquid supply (measured as a % of total tokens) to purchase, it doesn’t matter how cheap each token becomes because the limiting factor is not price. This price-insensitive defense mechanism is incredibly important to deter the potential negative feedback loop that declining prices could otherwise create.In the case of PoW, in addition to being 20x less efficient, there is no such defense mechanism. Each hardware unit may be marginally harder to acquire than the next, but there is no direct relationship, and if there is a correlation that does exist, it is weak at best. Importantly, it also becomes significantly easier to attack at lower prices as the number of hardware units required decreases linearly with price and the supply of hardware units does not change.It is not reflexive in the manner the PoS liquid supply defense is.Other advantages of PoS such as better energy efficiency and better healing mechanisms are articulated clearly elsewhere, therefore we will not focus on them in this piece.Another misconception about PoS is that it drives centralization by rewarding large stakers more than small stakers. We believe this to be incorrect.While large stakers receive more staking rewards than smaller stakers, this does not drive centralization. Centralization is the process by which large stakeholders increase their percentage of the stake over time.This is not what occurs in the PoS system. As large stakers have a larger stake to begin with, the larger rewards do not increase their percentage of the pool. For example, if 10 ETH is staked between two counterparties, Counterparty X has 9 ETH and counterparty Z has 1 ETH. X controls 90% of the stake. A year later X will have received 0.45 ETH and Z will have received .05 ETH. X has received 9 times the amount of rewards as Z. However, X still controls 90% of the stake and Z still controls 10%. The proportions have not been altered and therefore no centralization has occurred.These inherent differences impact the debate around ETH/BTC. Most consider ETH a totally different asset to BTC as they do think is designed to be a decentralized SoV (replace gold), while BTC is. We believe in many important ways Ethereum is better suited to be a long-term SoV than Bitcoin. Before we compare the two, it is first necessary to evaluate Bitcoin’s current security model and how it may evolve over time.As discussed earlier, a system’s security is derived from the cost of a 51% attack. As a PoW network, this cost is determined by the amount of money it would take to purchase enough hardware rigs and other equipment/electricity necessary to control 51% of the hash power.This is roughly equivalent to the cost necessary to recreate the current mining hash rate that exists on the network. In an efficient market (mostly an accurate assumption over the medium/long term), the total hash rate is a product of the value of the issuance that miners receive. Bitcoin is as secure as the value of its issuance. As discussed earlier, this security is both inefficient and importantly lacks the reflexive defense of a PoS system.What happens when Bitcoin halves its issuance every four years? The system fundamentally becomes 50% less secure assuming all other variables are held constant. Historically, this has not been a large problem as the value of the issuance (and therefore the security) is a function of two variables: the number of tokens issued and the value of each token.As the price of the tokens has more than doubled around every halving cycle, this has more than compensated for the issuance reduction on an absolute basis. The absolute security of the network has increased through each cycle despite the number of tokens being issued halving. However, this is not a sustainable dynamic long-term for multiple reasons. First, it is not realistic to expect the value of each token to continue to more than double with each cycle. An exponential price increase is mathematically impossible to sustain over long periods of time.To illustrate this point, if BTC price doubled every halving cycle it would exceed global M2 after ~7 more halving cycles. Eventually, BTC price will stop increasing at this rate; when it does each halving cycle will drastically cut into its security.If the BTC price declines around the halving cycle, the security reduction will be even more significant and could trigger the negative feedback loop referred to earlier. This security system is fundamentally unsustainable so long as prices are capped, which they are. The only way to counter this issue is to generate meaningful fee revenue.This fee revenue could then replace some of the issuance and continue providing an incentive for miners and therefore provide security even after issuance is reduced. The issue for Bitcoin is that fee revenue has been negligible, and also declining, over a long period of time.In our opinion, the only practical way to generate security over the long term is through significant fee revenue. Therefore, to function as a sustainable SoV a system must generate fees. The alternative is tail emissions, which guarantees inflation compromising the SoV utility.Long-term security represents the most important property of an SoV. For example, gold has captured the majority of the SoV market for so long as nearly all market participants are confident that it will remain legitimate long into the future.For a crypto asset to become an adopted and successful SoV, it too must convince the market that it is extremely secure and that its legitimacy is guaranteed. This can only be possible if the protocol’s security budget is sustainable for the long term, inherently favoring a PoS system that has a large and durable fee pool. We believe the most likely candidate for this system is ETH. It is one of only two L1s with a significant fee pool. The other, BNB, is extremely centralized.Credible neutrality is the second critically important characteristic of a successful SoV. Gold has no allegiance or reliance on anything. This independence creates its success as an SoV. For another asset to be widely adopted as an SoV it must also be credibly neutral. For a cryptocurrency credible neutrality is accomplished through decentralization. Today, the most decentralized cryptocurrency is undoubtedly Bitcoin. This is primarily because Bitcoin has very little development effort, and the protocol is mainly ossified, but nonetheless, the fact remains that it is by far the most decentralized protocol today. If you tried to kill Bitcoin today, it would be extremely hard. If you tried to kill ETH today, it would still be extremely hard, but likely easier than BTC.However, we believe it is more important to look at the end state than the current state so long as there is a realistic path to achieve this end state. Ethereum has a clear roadmap ahead of it. We believe that while we are currently only in the middle of this roadmap, eventually (I’d estimate ~8-12 years) this roadmap will be complete, and the significance of the core developer team will fade.At this point, ETH will have a compelling case that it is more decentralized than BTC in addition to possessing far superior long-term security.Contrary to popular belief, PoS naturally promotes decentralization more than PoW. Larger PoW miners receive a clear benefit from economies of scale, which drives centralization. Scale is much less relevant for PoS as the cost of setting up a node is vastly lower than a PoW rig and there is no real benefit to large-scale electricity as the electricity required for PoS is 99%+ lower.The economy of scale is a large factor for PoW but is not for PoS.400,000 unique ETH validators exist today and the top 5 holders only control 2.33% of the stake (excluding smart contract deposit). This level of decentralization and diversity separates ETH from all other PoS L1s. Furthermore, this compares to BTC favorably as the top 5 mining pools today control 70% of the hashrate.While some critics will point out that liquid staking providers control an overwhelming portion of Ethereum’s stake, we believe these concerns are overblown. Additionally, we expect these concerns to be addressed by the liquid staking protocols and expect additional checks to be put in place to further protect against these concerns.In summary, PoS is a fundamentally better consensus mechanism for a crypto SoV. This is the reason the Merge will represent a major milestone on Ethereum’s roadmap, marking a critical juncture in its journey to become the most appealing cryptographic SoV.The fundamental reasons discussed above are the reason we favor the ETH/BTC trade long-term and specifically around the Merge. However, flows, and specifically structural flows, are most important in determining price. It is the structural shift in flows that the Merge triggers that makes this trade so appealing and why the Merge is such a large catalyst for it. Historically, the structural flow for both BTC and ETH have been quite similar.Although ETH has had a smaller market cap its issuance has been ~3x larger on a market cap weighted basis. This larger issuance has made it extremely difficult for ETH to ever surpass Bitcoin in market cap as it would require ETH to absorb 3x the daily USD denominated supply. An interesting exercise is to think about the chart above and what the inputs are as clearly there has been a strong relationship (stronger than normal correlation would imply). The charted values are a product of tokens issued and token price. What happens if you reduce the tokens issued variable but want to retain the relationship? You must increase token price.So what should we expect to happen when we reduce the token issued variable for Ethereum by 90%? This is not to say that price should 10x to offset this reduction as the impacts are not necessarily linear, but the relationships are worth considering.To conclude, post-Merge the passage of time will forever be a flow tailwind for Ethereum while for Bitcoin it will always be a headwind. Ultimately, this straightforward reality is what we believe will be the primary driver of the eventual flippening.2. Staking DerivativesAs Ethereum is such a large ecosystem many other areas will be tangentially affected by the Merge. As an investor, it is often interesting (and profitable) to consider the second and third-order effects of certain catalysts to search for opportunities that may be inefficiently priced in the market. Regarding the Merge, there are many options such as L2s, DeFi, and Liquid Staking Derivative (LSD) protocols.After a comprehensive review of the different alternatives, we have concluded that the liquid staking protocols are set to be the largest fundamental beneficiaries of the Merge (even more so than ETH).The thesis is simple. The LSD protocols’ revenues are directly impacted by the price of ETH plus multiple other Merge related tailwinds that compound each other.  Additionally, their largest expense, the cost of subsidizing the liquidity pool between their staking derivate token and native ETH, declines, effectively to zero, shortly after the Merge. At a high level, I expect a 4-7x Merge driven increase in ETH protocol revenue (assuming only modest a ETH price increase) and a 60-80% reduction in their largest expense. This is a uniquely powerful fundamental impact.We must examine the revenue and expense model of these protocols to fully comprehend this thesis. Using Lido as an example, as it is the largest of the LSD protocols, let’s examine the model.Note that these principles also apply to the other players as they are generally quite similar. Lido generates revenue as a percentage of the staking rewards that accrue to their liquid staking derivatives, stETH. Lido receives 5% of all staking rewards generated. If a user deposits 10 ETH for 10 stETH and generates an additional 0.4 stETH over the course of a year. The user keeps 90% of 0.4, the validator keeps 5% and Lido keeps the other 5%. As can be seen, Lido’s revenue is purely a function of the staking rewards generated on its LSD.These staking rewards are a function of four separate variables: total ETH staked, ETH staking rate, LSD market share, and ETH price.Importantly, the staking rewards are the product of all four variables. If multiple variables are impacted their effect on the output compounds. In other words, if you double one and triple the other the impact on the staking rewards is 600%. All the variables, except market share, are directly impacted by the Merge.Total ETH staked will likely increase dramatically from the current 12% to closer to ~30% a 150% increase. As discussed earlier, the staking rate is likely to increase from 4% to ~5%, a 25% increase. There is no reason to think the Merge will significantly impact LSD market share so we can assume this is held constant and has no impact. Lastly, for the sake of this exercise let’s assume a 50% increase in the price of ETH. The aggregate effect of these different variables is 250%*118%*150%= 444% or a ~4.4x increase in revenue.Expenses also meaningfully drop. The largest expense of these LSD protocols is incentivizing the liquidity pools between their LSD and native ETH. Given there are no withdrawals yet, it is extremely important to create deep liquidity to manage large flows between the LSD and native ETH.However, once withdrawals are enabled these incentives will no longer be required. As there will then be an arbitrage if the two ever differ materially, natural market forces will keep them relatively pegged as arbitrageurs buy the LSD on any dips.  This will allow the LSD protocols to drastically reduce their issuance (expenses), which will also materially reduce the sell pressure on the tokens.LDO is trading at ~144x revenue on a pre-Merge number but this declines to ~31x when you look at it on a post-Merge number. While not overly cheap by traditional measures, this is attractive for a high-growth strategic asset in the crypto space where valuations are typically elevated. Importantly, this is real revenue that will accrue to the protocol.A common concern among LDO critics is that this revenue does not get returned to holders. They often compare the protocol to Uniswap for this reason.While it is true the revenue is not passed through to token holders at current, we do not think this is a legitimate concern nor do we think the Uniswap comparison is correct—just because token holders do not receive cash flow today does not mean they will not in the future.We believe there will be a time when these returns are enabled. We also know that multiple large stakeholders agree on this issue. Furthermore, we do not think Lido should return cash today and would actually be very concerned with management’s competence if they did. This is an extremely early-stage business (~1.5 years old) that is still in its infancy growth phase. They require regular cash raises and are burning cash on a run rate basis today (this will change post-Merge).It would not be sensible to raise money from investors to cover the burn and then distribute protocol revenue to token holders, in turn increasing the burn. This would be akin to a startup paying out investor distributions with early revenue despite not generating enough revenue to cover expenses. This would never happen in the traditional capital markets because it is not rational.Many crypto participants are also concerned about Lido’s dominant market share. They have 90% share of the LSD market and stETH makes up ~31% of total staked ETH. While we think the concerns around centralization are overstated, we still believe Lido should remain below 33% share of staked ETH to eliminate any doubt about Ethereum’s credible neutrality. As far as the investment case for the protocol we do not think a 33% market share cap is concerning. In our opinion, there are many other growth vectors Lido can pursue other than market share, and the investment is already quite compelling with its current share.To conclude, Lido is a key piece of infrastructure in the Ethereum ecosystem that has established product market fit and dominant market share in what will remain an incredibly fast-growing portion of the market. In our opinion, the frequently cited concerns around the protocol are either misplaced or misrepresented. Furthermore, it is reasonably priced considering its past and expected future growth prospects and therefore represents one of the most investable assets in the space.While Lido is the market leader and largest player there are two other LSD protocols, Rocketpool and Stakewise, that also merit consideration. There are many unique aspects of each LSD and intricate detail that could be expanded upon. However, for the sake of digestibility, we will focus primarily on the high-level differences and expand upon the finer points in future discussions.Both RPL and SWISE should benefit from any share that Lido cedes due to the centralization concerns. While we think any Lido share losses will be modest, even modest losses for Lido would equate to outsized gains for the smaller players.For example, if LDO loses 4% market share, RPL gains 2.5% of that, and SWISE gains 1.5%, LDO will lose ~12% of their market share but RPL will gain ~50% and SWISE ~125%.The 2nd largest player in the market, Rocketpool (RPL), has a unique staking mechanism and tokenomics. To stake through RPL, validators must pair RPL with native ETH and are required to maintain a minimum ratio between the two. This dynamic creates predictable and guaranteed demand for RPL as the ETH staking participation rises and more validators adopt the solution.Another benefit of RPL is the practice of validators pooling with other users, allowing the required ETH to set up a staking node to be reduced from the normal 32 ETH to only 16 ETH. This reduced minimum allows for smaller operators to set up nodes and further incentivizes decentralization. This makes RPL a perfect complementary player to LDO, which should act as a tailwind for RPL’s market share as they will be a primary beneficiary of Lido’s effective market share cap.Lastly, Stakewise is another interesting alternative to LDO. Their model is very similar to LDO’s but they are focused increasingly on institutional adoption, which should position them well for a post-Merge marketplace. They also benefit from a highly driven and professional team that has continued to execute well. Notably, they have discussed plans to eventually implement token-holder-friendly tokenomics that would see token holders directly receive excess protocol revenue.Additionally, SWISE has been gaining notable traction with larger accounts looking to diversify their staking products (one proposal alone was recently approved by Nexus Mutual which would increase their TVL by 20-25%).As they are the smallest player with the highest valuation, they are likely the highest risk/reward investment in the category.To conclude, it’s hard to differentiate between value within the group. LDO is the cheapest and most secure, but with the least market share upside. SWISE is the most expensive, but with the most market share upside and RPL is in between with the added benefit of unique tokenomics and a decentralizing staking mechanism. Relative valuations are rational which suggests to us the market is efficiently pricing the different opportunities.We have elected to own all three. We believe the LSD tokens are the highest EV Merge-related investments!They will likely outperform ETH, but investors should expect higher volatility and lower liquidity.The Merge Is ComingThe Ethereum Merge is coming.

Here's our response.,,"Argument 4: Yield will go down Jordi argues that ETH staking yields are coming down bigly. In a year when those risks are behind, ETH staking Mall Cops will be lucky to be earning 1–2% APY after token inflation, even lower than US treasury bonds. In 2023, we will see somewhere between 30 and 60M ETH staked Wait, is this bearish? Because this is actually the same thing as my bull case. If the ETH yield has gone down so low, it’s because a significant amount of ETH has begun staking, and the issuance is spread out among a wide set of participants. This is what an ETH bull would want to see . Low ETH yield means that there’s a ton of locked up ETH. There’s a lower and lower float as more and more ETH gets staked. It also means that ETH yield in DeFi is also strong, meaning that DeFi has also sucked up a lot of ETH from the secondary market too. I find it hard to see 30m to 60m of ETH staked, and it also being bearish. A high supply of staked ETH has always been one of the core pillars of ETH value accrual, no matter what the associated yield on the ETH. If people are willing to accept lower and lower yields on their ETH, to the point that yields drop down below 3%, it’s because the asset is extremely desirable, and owners are willing to be paid less to own it. Also, if we’re worried about a supply overhang from the Merge, why are we also seeing the supply of staked ETH grow from 14m where it is today, to 30 to 60m ETH in 2023?

We dropped a new episode with Justin Drake talking about the biggest threat to Ethereum. Must listen. Action Steps 🤑 Execute any good market opportunities that you saw 🎙 Listen to Ethereum Uncensored with Justin Drake","Dear Bankless Nation,Last week, Jordi Alexander wrote a piece in the Bankless Newsletter titled Is the Merge Overhyped?Ever since Jordi came on Bankless and helped us unpack the ticking time bomb that was Terra (about a month before it collapsed), I’ve enjoyed his rational and sober thoughts on the market. Reading his bear case for the Merge was a great exercise, one which I certainly have a hard time seeing on my own.However…I think there are some big things that Jordi either got wrong or overemphasized!I’ve written some rebuttals to the parts of Jordi’s piece which I think needed them the most.Tl;dr:Bearish because of low gas fees? Don’t be; it’s the issuance reduction that’s the big deal.Bearish because of the locked ETH overhang? Maybe… but I think this is overstated.Bearish because yields are going to be low? Don’t be; that’s actually the bull case that we’re looking for.Let’s dive in.Is the Merge Overhyped?Argument 1: It’s just a narrative playJordi’s first argument is that ‘this is yet another narrative trade opportunity, in an endlessly long line of crypto narrative trading opportunities’. Baked into this argument is the idea of “it doesn’t matter how fundamentally strong the catalyst is, the market can always front-run the opportunity faster than the catalyst is strong.”I think this is a cop-out argument. This is just saying that any and every event will be forgotten by time, and we’ll be on to the next narrative once it’s over.This leaves no possible room for anything about the Merge to be fundamentally bullish. It’s shutting the door before we’re even discussing the merits.“Lalala, doesn’t matter, sell the news”.IMO, the counter-argument to this is easy.The Ethereum merge is one of the most significant events in crypto’s history since the genesis of Ethereum itself. Not only that, but it’s also one that’s fundamentally about price and value.If there’s ever going to be something significant enough to break through the ‘traders gonna trade’ mimetic, it’s the Ethereum merge.If you don’t believe this sentiment, check out this Twitter poll from Eric Wall:Just over half say the Ethereum Merge will happen as advertised. Another 32.7% say either something will go wrong, or it won’t happen.That’s 62% saying the Merge is going to happen, and 38% saying it won’t or something will go wrong.Now, if you’re like Me, Ryan, Anthony Sassano, or any of the Ethereum client teams and core devs, you think there’s a >95% chance of the Merge happening on September 15th, and it being a complete success.If the market is pricing in less than 95% success, then I claim that the Merge isn’t priced in.Place your bets I guess, but it’s worth noting that the people who are experts on the details of the Merge are more bullish on its success than the people responding in this poll.Eric Wall’s Twitter following is also a wide variety of many different communities, so while Twitter polls aren’t great data tools, I think this is an anomaly that accurately reflects a wide distribution of communitiesArgument 2: Gas fees are down badJordi’s next argument is that gas fees are down bad.He’s right, they are.“During the last 30 days in the month of August, during which ETH price has been up over +50%, the gas burn has been a mere ~1,300 ETH per day.”Through this, the burn rate from EIP 1559 becomes negligible, creating a headwind on the narrative that ETH becomes ultra sound money. 🦇🔊He also argues that gas fees will never return to DeFi Summer or NFT Mania levels. Both smart contract and NFT sale mechanisms have become much more efficient and gas optimized, and also the L2 ecosystem is far more developed and ready to soak up a lot of L1 blockspace demand.He’s right!I can totally get behind Jordi’s argument that the days of 200+ gwei gas prices are over.But I also think that the current paradigm of 8-12 gwei average gas prices is also low. We’re in a bear market. We’re hungover from 2021. There are not many new things happening.Gas prices will once again return as soon as any semblance of price action also returns to crypto. There’s always a new thing to do. There’s always another bull market on the horizon.Jordi’s argument that 200+ gas fees are an anomaly; my argument is that 8-12 gwei gas prices are also an anomaly.And we only need 15 gwei to be net negative on ETH issuance.BUT MUCH MORE IMPORTANTLY, THIS WHOLE THING IS OVERSTATED.The Merge is about the issuance reduction in block rewards! It’s not about the burn!10 Gwei gas prices burns ~1,000 ETH a day.Proof of Stake removes about ~13.5k ETH issuance per day.Who gives an F about the low gas prices; the issuance reduction has always been the faster horse. The burn is just the cherry on top. This effect is why some ETH bulls are expecting to see the Merge’s impact on ETH price relatively quickly; months not years.When ETH’s issuance reduction goes down to 0.43%, are we really going to say it’s not bullish when the rest of the L1s look like this?Argument 3: Locked Staked ETH will DumpJordi’s next argument is that the supply of staked ETH and its rewards will hang over the market. In turn, the possibility of significant sell pressure once the unlock happens is scaring investors.Maybe the narrative of this is true, but the actual facts behind this narrative don’t appear very bearish to me.First and foremost, PoS is a system that inherently rewards those who are most bullish on the asset.Some people began staking their ETH on the beacon chain early in the 2021 bull market; while ETH was just $400-$700 or so.Question for you; are these people:Itching to lock in their profits?Perma-bulls who were willing to take the unknown lockup period by staking ETH early and are likely never-sellers?If you staked your ETH while ETH was still below $1,000, you did it in the first ~6 weeks that the beacon chain went live. You willingly took on an unknown amount of lockup time, for ~6-7% yield on your ETH.Psychologically speaking, I don’t see this population of people being eager ETH sellers.If you are a low-conviction ETH staker, who wanted a liquidity exit door, they would have staked with Lido, which launched the same month as the beacon chain, and therefore you’ve been able to sell your stETH at any time.And even at current prices, ETH has gone up 2-4x for the earliest stakers. It’s not the 10-100x gains of private token markets that actually do move token prices downwards.Finally, the opening of a sell gate can also be mitigated by the equal-and-opposite ETH buying pressure from those who are waiting for the merge to de-risk Ethereum and buy ETH once the merge is in the rearview mirror.Argument 4: Yield will go downJordi argues that ETH staking yields are coming down bigly.In a year when those risks are behind, ETH staking Mall Cops will be lucky to be earning 1–2% APY after token inflation, even lower than US treasury bonds.

In 2023, we will see somewhere between 30 and 60M ETH stakedWait, is this bearish?Because this is actually the same thing as my bull case.If the ETH yield has gone down so low, it’s because a significant amount of ETH has begun staking, and the issuance is spread out among a wide set of participants.

It is not indicative of our opinion on the long-run potential of each token.The rating scale is as follows:✅ Overweight: We expect this token to outperform the broader market over the next six months.➖ Neutral: We expect this token to perform in line with the market over the next six months.❌ Underweight: We expect this token to underperform the market over the next six months.To help inform our ratings, we also provide valuation estimates for any of the applicable tokens using a discounted cash flow (DCF) model. These models aim to value each protocol's core business offerings based on the revenues it generates and its future growth prospects, which are influenced by the catalysts discussed in this report. It is not applicable to all protocols covered in the report as not all of them are generating revenue.While these models are certainly not the only factor that goes into determining a token’s rating, especially given the short-time horizon on which they are made, we view these fair value estimates as the price ceiling under which we would consider the token to be undervalued and if above, overvalued.Now that’s out of the way, let’s dive into the report.✅ OverweightThese are tokens we believe will outperform the market over the next six-months.🧬 Synapse (SYN)Type: Coverage InitiationSector: Infrastructure - Bridging💲 Current FDV: $320.85MWe are initiating coverage of Synapse with a rating of overweight.Key CatalystsSynapse is being assigned this rating due to the upcoming resumption of Arbitrum Odyssey.Arbitrum Odyssey is an upcoming event that is designed to encourage adoption of Arbitrum based projects on Arbitrium by users with custom NFTs. The eight-week long event, which was postponed, is likely to resume in the near future following the recently completed Nitro network upgrade.It has also been speculated that Odyssey participants may be able to earn an airdrop of Arbitrum’s (still to be announced) governance token, meaning the event is likely to drive an increase in liquidity and activity on the network.Potential Price ImpactThe expected growth in usage and liquidity inflows into Arbitrum following the resumption of Odyssey should lead to an increase in bridging volumes on Synapse.This in-turn should grow Synapse’s revenues, as a swap-fee is charged as a percentage of every transfer made via the network. Synapse should also benefit from the upcoming rollout of Synapse Chain, an EVM-compatible optimistic rollup that will settle to Ethereum and utilize Synapse’s messaging protocol to enable developers to create cross-chain applications.🦄 Uniswap (UNI)Type: Ratings ChangePrevious Rating: UnderweightSector: DeFi - DEX💲 Current FDV: $6.30BKey CatalystsUniswap is being upgraded due to the “fee-switch pilot” proposal.The proposal suggests turning on the protocol fee-switch, a mechanism that enables the Uniswap DAO to take a share of the fees earned by liquidity providers, for three pools on the DEX for 120 days. The proposal would levy a 10% fee, with all earnings accruing to the DAO and not being distributed to stockholders.The proposal has currently passed through the first two phases of Uniswap governance (temperature and consensus check) with 99% support and is awaiting the final, on-chain vote.Potential Price ImpactAlthough the pools selected in the proposal account for roughly ~6% of total fees generated by the platform, successfully turning on the fee-switch will demonstrate to the market that Uniswap is capable of generating revenue and a proposal to do so can make its way through the DAO’s difficult to navigate governance process.This, coupled with the increasing emphasis placed on protocol cash flows, should lead to increased investor interest in Uniswap moving forward.➖ NeutralThese are tokens we believe will perform in-line with the market over the next six-months.〽️ Maker (MKR)Type: Ratings ChangePrevious Rating: NeutralSector: DeFi - Stablecoin💲 Current FDV: $760.78MWe are downgrading MKR from overweight to neutral.Key CatalystsMKR is being downgraded due regulatory uncertainty following the blacklisting of Tornado Cash by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).On August 8, OFAC announced that they will be sanctioning usage of the mixing service Tornado Cash. The leveling of these sanctions has resulted in numerous services taking steps to comply with the ruling, such as Circle, the issuer of USDC freezing funds in addresses that had used the protocol, while perpetuals exchange DYDX has blocked Tornado Cash users from interacting with their product.Potential Price ImpactWhile Maker was not directly impacted by this event, the OFAC sanctions, and Circle’s subsequent response, indicates that the USDC issuer will take proactive steps to comply with US regulations.Although there has been no indication that Maker is being targeted by regulators, this nonetheless poses a risk to the protocol, as DAI is currently backed 51.2% by USDC-based assets between the peg-stability module and G-UNI pools. While Maker should benefit from the increased emphasis among investors on protocol cash flows, this uncertainty nonetheless may dampen liquidity demand, and its ability to scale using centralized assets in the near future.↪️ Curve Finance (CRV)Coverage Type: Coverage InitiationSector: DeFi - DEX💲 Current FDV: $3.76BWe are initiating coverage of CRV with a rating of neutral.Catalyst Overview:CRV is being assigned this rating due to the upcoming launch of Curve’s stablecoin.Curve has revealed that they will launch their own native stablecoin, potentially as soon as September 2022. Although there have been scant details surrounding its implementation, it is suggested that the stablecoin will be over-collateralized.Curve’s foray into the stablecoin sector comes amidst a broader trend of applications issuing their own currencies, with other prominent protocols, such as Aave set to launch their own.Price Impact:The launch of crvUSD should increase Curve’s revenues, as the protocol should be able to charge some sort of fee related to the issuance and/or borrowing of their stablecoin.It is also likely that a portion of this revenue will be paid out to tokenholders, increasing the yield that can be earned from locking CRV for veCRV. Despite this, with a broader macro backdrop, CRV may continue to be face sell-pressure from perpetual, albeit soon to be reduced, emissions, as liquidity providers will sell the token in order to lock in their returns.❌ UnderweightThese are tokens we believe will underperform the market over the next six-months.🚴 Velodrome (VELO)Type: Coverage InitiationSector: DeFi - DEXCurrent FDV: $11.00MWe are initiating coverage of Velodrome with a rating of underweight.Key CatalystsVelodrome is being assigned this rating due to a decline in TVL and trading volumes. Over the past two weeks, Velodrome has seen its TVL fall 49.3% from $136.6M to $69.2M.This outflow in liquidity has helped fuel a decline in trading volumes on the DEX, with daily volumes having fallen 71.6% from $36.10M to $10.23M from its July 29 peak.Potential Price ImpactVelodrome’s liquidity outflows and declining volumes are likely to hamper performance of VELO, as a fall-off in trading activity decreases the yield earned by veVELO lockers, as they take a 0.02% cut of every trade.This decrease in usage is also likely to lead to a decline in bribe income for lockers. As a result, VELO may struggle to see enough buy pressure to offset emissions which is likely to fuel further outflows, as VELO-denominated yields for liquidity providers will decrease.☀️ Solana (SOL)Type: Ratings ChangePrevious Rating: OverweightSector: L1Current MC: $11.02BSOL is being downgraded from overweight to underweight.Key CatalystsSOL is being downgraded due to increased competitive pressure.Competition at the network level continues to intensify. There are several new L1’s who are closing or looking to close nine-figure private rounds, such as Sui and Aptos, two Move-based smart contract platforms. In addition, Ethereum-based L2’s continue to take market-share, with networks such as Arbitrum and Optimism having grown their combined share of TVL from 1.90% to 3.55% over the past three months. Solana has seen its share of TVL fall from 3.05% to 2.44% during this period.Potential Price ImpactThese competitive headwinds are likely to weigh on the price of SOL in the near-future, as user activity, liquidity, and investor attention looks elsewhere. In addition, Solana faces continued competitive pressure for one of the core-value propositions of the network, low transaction fees, as rollups such as Arbitrum and Optimism launch capacity-increasing network upgrades such as Nitro and Bedrock.📚 Bankless Token BibleYour essential resource for leveling up on crypto tokens and analysis.Access Bankless Token BibleCovered TokensTheir ratings are as follows:FXS: Overweight ✅BAL: Overweight ✅BTRFLY: Overweight ✅SNX: Overweight  ✅GMX: Overweight ✅LDO: Overweight ✅OP: Overweight ✅RPL: Overweight ✅AAVE: Overweight ✅ATOM: Neutral ➖SUSHI: Underweight ❌DYDX: Underweight ❌COMP: Underweight ❌TRIBE: Underweight ❌AVAX: Underweight ❌ENS: Underweight ❌APE: Underweight ❌PERP: Underweight ❌📚 Tap into the Bankless Token Bible",https://www.bankless.com/bankless-token-ratings-september,2022-09-09T00:00:00.000Z,"https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/image/fetch/w_1200,h_600,c_limit,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https-3a-2f-2fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com-2fpublic-2fimages-2f1e1ae689-0810-4861-a795-12e4f9f0181d_1422x796.jpg",Ben Giove,Bankless,blog,Unknown Error,

Rather than allowing their business to go to zero, these miners have announced their plans to fork the Merge and maintain a proof-of-work version of Ethereum ( ETHPOW ). If that happens, you may own a copy of every single existing digital token on the ghost town replica version of the old Ethereum chain. Some of these tokens might have value, most of them won’t. If you’re thinking of dumping them for a quick profit, proceed with extreme caution! There are many technical challenges that you’ll need to watch out for. Today, William provides us with a handy checklist as to what to look out for. Here’s how to win the Ethereum PoW fork, if there is one. - Bankless team During the Merge when the rest of the Ethereum community migrates to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), a group of miners plan to fork off and maintain a Proof-of-Work (PoW) alternative. This fork, known as EthPoW, isn’t poised to have a serious future right now, but it should grant ETH holders new ETHPOW tokens on a 1:1 basis. Interacting with ETHPOW can be extremely risky, so this Bankless tactic will give you a checklist you can use to navigate the fork safely. Goal : Sell your EthPOW for ETH if possible Skill : Intermediate Effort : 1 hour ROI : Potentially growing your ETH stack ETHPOW Safety Checklist 🔀 ✅ Understand the basics of the Merge The tl;dr of the Merge is as follows: Ethereum is migrating from PoW to PoS consensus. PoW uses energy ( in the form of computation) for security. PoS uses capital ( in the form of crypto tokens) for security. The former is obviously very energy-intensive, while the latter is extremely energy efficient. The result is that Ethereum’s energy use will drop by ~99% upon shifting to PoS. This Merge to PoS has overwhelming community support, meaning a near total majority of Ethereum community members and projects are migrating to the updated Ethereum chain and won’t support any PoW forks. ✅ Understand the basics of the EthPoW fork","Dear Bankless Nation,When that countdown hits zero, most of the Ethereum ecosystem will move on to the new Proof-of-Stake chain, except for a handful of disgruntled Ethereum miners who will be sitting on million dollars worth of mining rigs.Rather than allowing their business to go to zero, these miners have announced their plans to fork the Merge and maintain a proof-of-work version of Ethereum (ETHPOW).If that happens, you may own a copy of every single existing digital token on the ghost town replica version of the old Ethereum chain.Some of these tokens might have value, most of them won’t.If you’re thinking of dumping them for a quick profit, proceed with extreme caution!There are many technical challenges that you’ll need to watch out for.Today, William provides us with a handy checklist as to what to look out for.Here’s how to win the Ethereum PoW fork, if there is one.- Bankless teamDuring the Merge when the rest of the Ethereum community migrates to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), a group of miners plan to fork off and maintain a Proof-of-Work (PoW) alternative.This fork, known as EthPoW, isn’t poised to have a serious future right now, but it should grant ETH holders new ETHPOW tokens on a 1:1 basis.Interacting with ETHPOW can be extremely risky, so this Bankless tactic will give you a checklist you can use to navigate the fork safely.Goal: Sell your EthPOW for ETH if possibleSkill: IntermediateEffort: 1 hourROI: Potentially growing your ETH stackETHPOW Safety Checklist 🔀✅ Understand the basics of the MergeThe tl;dr of the Merge is as follows:Ethereum is migrating from PoW to PoS consensus.PoW uses energy (in the form of computation) for security. PoS uses capital (in the form of crypto tokens) for security. The former is obviously very energy-intensive, while the latter is extremely energy efficient.The result is that Ethereum’s energy use will drop by ~99% upon shifting to PoS.This Merge to PoS has overwhelming community support, meaning a near total majority of Ethereum community members and projects are migrating to the updated Ethereum chain and won’t support any PoW forks.✅ Understand the basics of the EthPoW forkThe tl;dr of EthPoW:Since July 2022, a group of miners such as Chandler Guo have accelerated plans to fork off a PoW version of Ethereum either during the Merge or shortly thereafter.Since essentially all Ethereum activity is moving to the PoS chain, this EthPoW fork doesn’t have a serious value proposition — it’s a money grab posing as a permissionless blockchain for the participating miners to maintain some semblance of dominance in a post-Merge world.When it launches, EthPoW will “airdrop” ETHPOW tokens to ETH holders on a 1:1 basis. Trying to sell these tokens can expose you to replay attacks, in which an attacker “replays” your EthPoW transaction on the real Ethereum chain and steals your funds accordingly. More on this attack vector directly below ⬇️✅ Check the ChainIDThe tl;dr of the EthPoW ChainID situation is as follows:ChainID was initially introduced in EIP-155 to mitigate replay attacks between the Ethereum and Ethereum Classic Chains; the former’s ChainID stayed at 1, while Ethereum Classic moved to 61.At the time of this post’s writing, EthPoW’s developers still have not updated their fork’s ChainID from 1 in their codebase — this means EthPoW is on the verge of launching with the same ChainID as Ethereum.If EthPoW proceeds with this dangerous dynamic, it will create ideal conditions for blackhats to conduct replay attacks.🚨 DO NOT INTERACT WITH THE ETHPOW FORK UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES IF THE NETWORK LAUNCHES WITH THE CHAINID OF 1. YOU COULD LOSE ALL OF YOUR ETH. 🚨In other words, the first major item on this checklist is checking whether EthPoW’s initial ChainID is 1 or the planned alternative of 10001. If the creators go with the former and not the latter, do not attempt to interact with the fork at any point.Additionally, some DeFi projects like Maker’s Dai stablecoin are hard-coded to use a ChainID of 1, meaning interacting with their EthPoW versions will open you up to replay attacks no matter what. Check projects’ recent comms on a case-by-case basis to see where they stand here.✅ Determine if ETHPOW’s worth the troubleLet’s say EthPoW hypothetically launches with a ChainID of 10001, mitigating most replay attack concerns — even with that out of the way, will the value of ETHPOW warrant going through the time and effort to claim the tokens?That’s the big question for now! At the time of this post’s writing, ETHPOW IOUs were valued at $29.30 per token.Also, the difference between the spot price of ETH right now ($1,726) and the current price of ETH Sept. 30th futures ($1,710) suggests an implied ETHPOW price of ~$16 pre-launch.Claiming tokens that are worth $16-$30 each won’t be financially worthwhile for many ETH holders, though there is the possibility that price discovery pushes the ETHPOW price higher than this range upon its arrival on exchanges. On the flip side, ETHPOW may see its price quickly crater as many people sell the token en masse.✅ Prep your ETH stackIf EthPoW actually starts with a ChainID of 10001 and ETHPOW tokens start out with some decent price action, it may be worth your time to sell your ETHPOW for real ETH, USD, etc.To potentially prepare for selling ETHPOW, you’ll have the best assurances by holding your ETH in a non-custodial wallet that you totally control before the EthPoW fork. If you have ETH in an exchange wallet, that exchange may keep your ETHPOW airdrop for itself.Additionally, make sure pre-fork that you’re holding your ETH on Ethereum and not on an L2, e.g. Arbitrum. Only ETH on Ethereum will be credited with ETHPOW tokens on EthPow.Also unwrap your Wrapped ETH (WETH) to ETH pre-fork so you don’t have to bother with trying to unwrap your WETH on the EthPoW side of things once/if it goes live.Also withdraw your ETH from DeFi liquidity pools because you won’t be credited with ETHPOW for any ETH you have sitting in liquidity pools at the time of the fork.Consider borrowing ETH using a DeFi lending protocol to maximize your ETH holdings pre-fork; however, note that some lending protocols like Aave have already paused ETH borrowing amid a surge in borrowing activity.✅ Pick your exchangeSome exchanges, like BitMEX, have already announced plans to support ETHPOW trading.That said, it may take some exchanges days, weeks, or months to support ETHPOW deposits and/or account credits — make sure you land on an exchange that has clearly detailed its support plans so you know exactly what you can do and when you can do it.Worried? Do NothingRight now, there are a lot of “ifs” that go into considering whether or not you should try to sell ETHPOW.The critical thing to remember is that not playing is a viable strategy here.If you can’t make it through the checklist outlined above with confidence, “winning the EthPoW fork” may simply mean abstaining and observing the chaos from the sidelines.The biggest question outstanding is whether or not this unremarkable fork rolls out with a ChainID of 1 or 10001. If 1, then DO NOT INTERACT WITH THE FORK because the risks of replay attacks against your real ETH far outweigh what you could gain from selling.The best case scenario?EthPoW starts with the 10001 ChainID and you’re able to deposit ETHPOW to a supporting exchange and then cash out a decent sum to USD, or buy more ETH, or whatever’s right for you.However, at this point it seems unlikely the EthPoW launch will go smoothly.Action steps☑️ Run through the ETHPOW safety checklist described above before making a decision on how to approach EthPoW🕵 Also check out our previous How to use DeFi privately tactic if you missed it!",https://www.bankless.com/how-to-win-the-ethereum-pow-fork,2022-09-13T00:00:00.000Z,"https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/image/fetch/w_1200,h_600,c_limit,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https-3a-2f-2fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com-2fpublic-2fimages-2f4fc94b11-3631-4efa-9b09-6e7c70772b5e_2668x1501.jpg",William M.

It is not indicative of our opinion on the long-run potential of each token.The rating scale is as follows:✅ Overweight: We expect this token to outperform the broader market over the next six months.➖ Neutral: We expect this token to perform in line with the market over the next six months.❌ Underweight: We expect this token to underperform the market over the next six months.To help inform our ratings, we also provide valuation estimates for any of the applicable tokens using a discounted cash flow (DCF) model.These models aim to value each protocol's core business offerings based on the revenues it generates and its future growth prospects, which are influenced by the catalysts discussed in this report. It is not applicable to all protocols covered in the report as not all of them are generating revenue.While these models are certainly not the only factor that goes into determining a token’s rating, especially given the short-time horizon on which they are made, we view these fair value estimates as the price ceiling under which we would consider the token to be undervalued and if above, overvalued.Now that’s out of the way, let’s dive into the report.✅ OverweightThese are tokens we believe will perform in-line with the market over the next six-months.🟣 Polygon (MATIC)Analyst: Ben GioveType: Coverage InitiationSector: L1Current FDV: $8.4BWe are initiating coverage of MATIC with a rating of overweight.Key CatalystsMATIC is being assigned an overweight rating due to the upcoming launch of the Polygon zkEVM.In July 2022, Polygon revealed that they were developing and would soon be launching a EVM-compatible, zero-knowledge (zk) rollup, which they refer to as the zkEVM.The zkEVM is thought of as a silver-bullet scaling solution, as it combines the firepower of zkrollups, which have greater transaction throughput than optimistic rollups, while benefiting from the network effects of the EVM through inheriting its developer tooling and supporting infrastructure.The hype is rolling in with Polygon’s zkEVM expected to launch its mainnet in early 2023.Potential Price ImpactThe launch of the zkEVM should lead MATIC to outperform as the token will likely be used to decentralize portions of the network such as the sequencer.In addition, the zkEVM should increase demand for MATIC, as there is a strong possibility the token will be able to be used to pay for gas on the network. Finally, MATIC should also benefit from a wider valuation re-rating among-L2 tokens, as by launching their own, Polygon will be associated with being a rollup provider rather than a standalone Layer 1.🎀 Ribbon Finance (RBN)Analyst: Ben GioveType: Coverage InitiationSector: L1Current FDV: $277.9MWe are initiating coverage of RBN with a rating of overweight.Key CatalystsRibbon is being assigned an overweight rating due to the launch of Aevo in Q4.The exchange will utilize an orderbook model, the same one employed in CeFi by platforms such as Derbit, and will serve as the infrastructure for Ribbon’s options vaults (DOV), which run automated covered call, cash-secured put, and twin-win strategies.Potential Price ImpactThe launch of Aevo should lead to a significant increase in Ribbon’s top-line, as the protocol will be able to generate revenue from trading fees as well as profits from sequencing transactions on their rollup.This will increase yields for veRBN lockers, who earn a 50% cut of protocol revenue which is paid in ETH.Aevo may also increase the utility of RBN, as in the long-run, it is possible the token is used to decentralize the sequencer via a proof-of-stake system. These factors should help offset sell-pressure the sell-pressure from both team and investor unlocks, which began in May 2022, as well as from RBN emissions to the protocols various options vaults.➖ NeutralThese are tokens we believe will perform in-line with the market over the next six-months.🔴 Optimism (OP)Analyst: Ben GioveType: Ratings ChangeSector: L2Current FDV: $3.7BWe are downgrading OP from overweight to neutral.Key CatalystsOP is being assigned this rating due to the sell pressure from incentive programs.Optimism is continuing to distribute OP tokens from their governance fund, where projects can request tokens to be used for purposes such as liquidity mining incentives or rebates.The governance fund has an allocation of 5.4% of the total OP supply, with the potential for that to increase by an additional 8.8%. To date, $41.36M (~1.1% of the OP supply) has been distributed to projects for use as incentives via the fund.Potential Price ImpactThe continued use of OP for incentives is likely to weigh on price, as yield farmers will likely continue to sell the token in order to lock in their returns. Although OP should benefit from the previously mentioned valuation re-rating among L2 tokens as well as from tokenomics upgrades such as being used to decentralize the sequencer, this continued source of sell-pressure will diminish the chance of outsized returns in the short-run.🦉 Index Coop (INDEX)Analyst: Jack InabinetType: Coverage InitiationSector: DeFi - Asset ManagementCurrent MC: $24.4MWe are initiating coverage of INDEX with a rating of neutral.Key CatalystsIndex Coop is receiving a rating of neutral due to consistent declines in TVL.Since September of 2021, the Protocol’s ETH-denominated TVL has slid by 58.2%, despite broader DeFi TVL remaining relatively consistent over the same period.Additionally, the protocol’s auto compounding staked ETH strategy (icETH) failed to attract significant inflows, despite increased yield on the product resulting from the Merge.Potential Price ImpactWhile current DeFi players lack the appetite for Index Coop’s products, we believe that Index Coop has the potential to become a powerful primitive for DeFi markets.TradFi indexers wield vast amounts of power. The S&P 500 and its benchmarked funds are vehicles for $15.6 trillion in passive investments.Newly listed companies to the index experience massive increases in demand for their stock, while delisted firms incur the opposite effect. INDEX holders control the launch of new products and the governance rights of the assets in Index Coop’s current indices. Decentralizing the power of the indexer allows INDEX to accrue value, as holders are able to direct passive flows towards specific protocols and sectors.The success of DeFi indices at large remains circumspect, and the dominance of Index Coop even more so. Despite the low probability of the protocol’s success, the prospect of outsized influence for the INDEX token merits a neutral rating.❌ UnderweightThese are tokens we believe will underperform the market over the next six-months.🏦 Maker (MKR)Analyst: Jack InabinetType: Ratings ChangeSector: DeFi - StablecoinCurrent FDV: $829.4MWe are downgrading MKR from neutral to underweight.Key CatalystsMaker (MKR) is being downgraded for a second month in a row, stemming from continued and increasing regulatory risks.On October 3, the US Treasury Department’s Financial Stability Oversight Committee (FSOC) released a report advocating for increased regulation of crypto assets, particularly of stablecoins.This report follows the Treasury Department’s September report, which also called for increased stablecoin and crypto regulations. Compliance with proposed regulations involves implementation of AML/KYC/CFT programs, which may be impossible, given the decentralized nature of the Maker. Additionally, the FSOC signaled its opposition to automated liquidation features, which create “financial instability and [have] investor protection implications.” Current regulatory regimes appear to leave little room for decentralized stablecoins.Potential Price Impact:Proposed regulations would most likely decrease Maker’s market reach and may reduce protocol TVL, in the event Maker is forced to implement AML/KYC/CFT programs. Additionally, outlawing automated liquidation would essentially hamstring the protocol and greatly reduce investor confidence in DAI during market drawdown events. The end result of this event: protocol insolvency.Maker has been down only since May, 2021. The specter of regulation looms ever closer. Continued murmurs of regulation, growing in severity, will negatively impact price. The hawkish stance taken by regulators from Treasury and the FSOC are taking towards stablecoins should give HODLers cause for concern.While the extent of future regulation is unclear at this time, it is likely that the stablecoin sector will see some form of regulation, which may hinder operations.🐈‍⬛ Frax Finance (FXS)Analyst: Jack InabinetType: Ratings ChangePrevious Rating: OverweightSector: DeFi - StablecoinCurrent FDV: $480.2MFXS is being downgraded from overweight to underweight.Key CatalystsAs a decentralized stablecoin issuer, Frax Finance will confront the same hurdles that Maker will.Unlike Maker, however, the protocol’s stablecoin, FRAX, is under-collateralized. The protocol currently has a collateralization ratio of 93%. A recent bill in the US House of Representatives proposes a 2-year ban on the issuance of all algorithmic stablecoins.While this bill has faced procedural and political challenges, stalling legislative progression, it is clear that Frax Finance faces significantly more risk to its business model than fellow stablecoin issuer Maker, and should be viewed as a stronger sell.Potential Price ImpactThe outlook on Maker is certainly bearish.The outlook for Frax? Even more so. A complete and total ban on algorithmic stablecoins is the end time for your FXS and FRAX bags. If such legislation was passed, it is likely that Circle (given its prior history) would freeze all USDC partially collateralizing FRAX, basically creating a LUNA-style bank run.This all depends on regulatory outcomes over the coming months and years.📚 Bankless Token BibleYour essential resource for leveling up on crypto tokens and analysis.Access Bankless Token BibleCovered TokensTheir ratings are as follows:UNI: Overweight ✅SYN: Overweight ✅BAL: Overweight ✅BTRFLY: Overweight ✅GMX: Overweight ✅LDO: Overweight ✅RPL: Overweight ✅AAVE: Overweight ✅ATOM: Neutral ➖CRV: Neutral ➖OP: Neutral ➖SUSHI: Underweight ❌VELO: Underweight ❌SOL: Underweight ❌DYDX: Underweight ❌COMP: Underweight ❌TRIBE: Underweight ❌AVAX: Underweight ❌ENS: Underweight ❌APE: Underweight ❌PERP: Underweight ❌📚 Tap into the Bankless Token Bible",https://www.bankless.com/bankless-token-ratings-october-2022,2022-10-07T00:00:00.000Z,"https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/image/fetch/w_1200,h_600,c_limit,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https-3a-2f-2fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com-2fpublic-2fimages-2f85160dfb-8e3c-451a-9d23-87716271fb84_1047x582.jpg",Jack Inabinet,Bankless,blog,Unknown Error,

But did you know DeFi exists on Bitcoin? Even though Bitcoin only supports basic transactions on the base layer, developers can build a DeFi ecosystem on top of the network while inheriting some of its high security guarantees. This has been in the making for awhile. And it’s now starting to come into fruition. Today, we’ll explore the basics of how to use DeFi on Bitcoin. Tomorrow, Muneeb Ali is sharing his vision for how Bitcoin scales this ecosystem to compete with smart contract platforms. Bankless covering Bitcoin?!?! Yup. ( don’t tell Ryan & David) Let’s get into it. - Bankless team Over the past couple of years, Ethereum has been the hub for DeFi activity while spreading to Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains like BSC, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, and so forth. However, Bitcoin has its own native DeFi ecosystem that, while still much smaller than EVM-based DeFi, is steadily coming together on layers built on top of the network ( we’ll talk more about this in tomorrow’s article!) . Accordingly, this Bankless tactic will show you how to explore Bitcoin DeFi as a beginner. Goal : Learn how to navigate the Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem Skill : Intermediate Effort : A couple hours ROI : Access to new DeFi frontiers, up to +8% APY via STX stacking Getting started in Bitcoin DeFi","Dear Bankless Nation,Everybody knows about DeFi on Ethereum and other smart contract platforms like Cosmos and Solana.But did you know DeFi exists on Bitcoin?Even though Bitcoin only supports basic transactions on the base layer, developers can build a DeFi ecosystem on top of the network while inheriting some of its high security guarantees.This has been in the making for awhile.And it’s now starting to come into fruition.Today, we’ll explore the basics of how to use DeFi on Bitcoin.Tomorrow, Muneeb Ali is sharing his vision for how Bitcoin scales this ecosystem to compete with smart contract platforms.Bankless covering Bitcoin?!?!Yup. (don’t tell Ryan & David)Let’s get into it.- Bankless teamOver the past couple of years, Ethereum has been the hub for DeFi activity while spreading to Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains like BSC, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, and so forth.However, Bitcoin has its own native DeFi ecosystem that, while still much smaller than EVM-based DeFi, is steadily coming together on layers built on top of the network (we’ll talk more about this in tomorrow’s article!).Accordingly, this Bankless tactic will show you how to explore Bitcoin DeFi as a beginner.Goal: Learn how to navigate the Bitcoin DeFi ecosystemSkill: IntermediateEffort: A couple hoursROI: Access to new DeFi frontiers, up to +8% APY via STX stackingGetting started in Bitcoin DeFiComing back to Bitcoin, DeFi editionBack in 2017, I pressed “Random” on Reddit and landed in r/ethtrader, starting my crypto journey.As such, I’m part of the newer wave of folks that actually came to crypto through Ethereum and not Bitcoin, the cryptoeconomy’s OG.At the time I took the first gig I could doing crypto news writing, so I started as a generalist. In 2018, I sold the last of my BTC for ETH and have pivoted my personal focus to Ethereum ever since.That said, that doubling down gave me front row seats to the rise of DeFi. I became an early user of Maker, borrowing the DAI stablecoin against my ETH, and have done this to finance things in my real life ever since.That capability made me a big DeFi believer early on, which led me to exploring as many DeFi projects as I could in recent years while the total value locked (TVL) in the ecosystem surged to new heights.DeFi’s peak so far was its $182B TVL on Dec. 2nd, 2021 - via DeFiLlamaAmid this surging we saw more and more innovation and variety. You could earn trading fees by LPing on Uniswap, Curve, and Balancer, you could borrow and lend on Aave and Compound, you could trade derivatives on dYdX and Opyn, and on and on!The world of decentralized finance was blooming.In this same upswing came a boom of other chains — from Alt-L1s to Ethereum-centric L2s.For the most part, the largest of these new chains have been EVM-based because of network effects, making it easier for the existing cohort to experiment with new chains.Solana is currently the only non-EVM-based chain in the top 10 of the current DeFi TVL rankings - via DeFiLlamaI’ve tried most EVM chains of note so far. Lately then I’ve been exploring non-EVM DeFi projects to learn more, such as how to trade on Cosmos’s Osmosis appchain like I outlined in my tactic last week.I feel fairly up to speed with most smart contract platforms, but I wanted a challenge.What about Bitcoin?Does DeFi on Bitcoin exist?To be sure, I’ve been out of the loop on Bitcoin for years.But now the OG blockchain does have the first makings of its own DeFi ecosystem coming together. It’s been built on systems that settle transactions on the base layer and execute all of the contract logic on-top of Bitcoin (sound familiar?).Accordingly, I thought it’d be interesting as an EVM guy to try some of the biggest Bitcoin DeFi projects I could and then write up a post on how to use these projects.Before getting into the action though, let’s quickly review Bitcoin’s “layers” approach to DeFi.Allow me to explain ⬇️Bitcoin DeFi 101: Beyond the Base LayerVia Bitcoin MagazineWhile DeFi can occur on Ethereum’s base layer, the Bitcoin base layer can only handle basic transactions. Smart contract logic doesn’t exist!As a result, the Bitcoin DeFi scene occurs one level up in the protocol layer where external projects can build on, and inherit security from, Bitcoin.Currently the largest of Bitcoin’s DeFi protocols is the Lightning Network, a Bitcoin L2 that uses payment channels to let people make extremely fast and low cost payments in decentralized fashion.Today, there is over 5,000 BTC deposited into Lightning, equivalent to ~$96M USD right now.Via DeFiLlamaNot bad! This puts Lightning as the 78th largest DeFi protocol behind the likes of Ribbon Finance and others.However, while there are ongoing efforts to build a more expressive app layer on top of Lightning itself, the network is suited only for payments right now.To tap into more advanced Bitcoin DeFi functionalities like borrowing, lending, and beyond, you have to go to general-purpose protocols that offer smart contract capabilities atop Bitcoin.The two biggest examples of these sorts of protocols today are RSK and Stacks, as RSK boasted a $51M TVL and Stacks an $11M TVL at the time of this post’s writing.RSK’s TVL is down (from its $229M peak) but not out - via DeFiLlamaBelow, let’s walk through the basics of how you could try this Bitcoin DeFi trifecta of Lightning, RSK, and Stacks for yourself.🔥 Interested in learning more about how Bitcoin scales DeFi?Tomorrow, one of the best experts in this area, Muneeb from BlockStacks, will publish an in-depth article on this topic. Strap in.⚡ Trying Lightning with BreezDecentralized payments are at the heart of DeFi, thus the Lightning Network is at the heart of Bitcoin DeFi.If you’re a Bitcoin DeFi newcomer like me, you’re interested in using the simplest possible way to interact with Lightning to first get the hang of things.Toward that end, a solid option to consider is Breez, a sleek non-custodial Lightning client designed for mobile devices.You don’t need any technical know-how, just download the app to your phone, deposit some BTC from another wallet or your crypto exchange of choice, and boom!You’re ready to use Lightning.Here’s the step by step:Download Breez through the Apple App Store or Google PlayPress Receive and then Receive via BTC address to generate a deposit addressDeposit your desired amount of BTC to your Breez address and wait for the deposit tx to be confirmedDone! Now you’re ready to start sending/paying BTC on Bitcoin’s first L2Personally, I wanted to try putting some of my newly deposited Lightning sats (short for “satoshis,” the smallest denomination of BTC) to good use, so I pulled up the Lightning address of the Human Rights Foundation via QR code and sent over around ~$50 worth of BTC.Very easy!Even though Breez is in beta, everything went smoothly.Color me impressed, but that’s just basic payments.We want to borrow, swap, and earn.We want DeFi.So, let’s move into more complicated Bitcoin-based DeFi possibilities by exploring RSK.🤿 Swap, Lend, Borrow, and More on RSKRSK is an EVM-compatible smart contract protocol that exists on Bitcoin.This sidechain, which uses merge mining to inherit some of Bitcoin’s extensive security guarantees, allows users to bridge their BTC to RSK’s native RBTC 1:1 pegged token and then put RBTC to use in Ethereum-like smart contracts.One of the largest DeFi apps on RSK right now is Sovryn.The downside is that RSK and Sovryn requires you to have RSK’s native token, the BTC-pegged RBTC, to pay for transactions.There are three ways to do this:⚡️ Fast: Buy some RBTC on a supporting exchange, like Bitfinex, Bisq, etc, and then transfer to your wallet/💨 Medium: Use the FastBTC transfer option using the RBTC Receive button on Sovryn to deposit BTC into RSK.🐢 Slow: Convert some BTC to RBTC using the official conversion process, which can take up to one day.Before diving into Sovryn you’ll want to add the RSK EVM chain to your wallet, e.g. your MetaMask.To do this, you can head to chainlist.org to search for and add the chain from there.Once your RBTC is ready on RSK, you can head to the Sovryn app and choose from DeFi activities like Borrowing, Lending, LPing, Margin Trading, Staking, and more.If you just want to swap tokens, you can head to the Swap hub and trade into whatever you want just like you would on any EVM-based DEX.Via Sovryn💰 Stacking Sats via staking STX on StacksStacks is another smart contract protocol built on top of Bitcoin.Unlike RSK, Stacks isn’t EVM-compatible, but if you’ve used any smart contract platforms before this protocol will feel generally familiar. The native token of the network is STX, which is needed to pay for transactions.Notably, Stacks offers a Stacking program that allows users to stake their STX tokens in order to support the network and earn BTC rewards from Stacks’s participating BTC miners. You could follow these steps to join in on the campaign:Download the popular Hiro Desktop Wallet for StacksBack up your wallet account for posterityAcquire STX on your crypto exchange of choice and then deposit it to your new Hiro Wallet addressOnce you’ve received your STX deposit head into your Hiro Wallet and click on the Get started button below the Stacking option, then click on the Stack in a pool optionFind a stacking pool address of your choice on stacks.co and then copy it into your Hiro UIInput the amount of STX to lock and whether you want your deposit to be of limited or indefinite durationConfirm the transaction with your wallet, and voila! Now you’ll be staking STX to stack sats, with the APY estimated to be +8% right nowBitcoin Needs DeFiThe Bitcoin DeFi scene is much more primitive than Ethereum’s DeFi scene as things currently stand, but it’s certainly not non-existent.And with Bitcoin’s block subsidy continuing to fall every four years, the OG blockchain can strongly benefit from increasingly thriving protocol and app layers bringing in more and more BTC transaction fees over time.In this regard the rise of projects like Lightning, RSK, and Stacks are very encouraging, though they are undoubtedly still quite early on in their lifespans. Additionally, these projects are only the firsts of more to come, as there are new contenders arriving all the while, like the DeFiChain sidechain effort.Keep your eyes on the old guard and the newcomers alike in the Bitcoin DeFi scene accordingly!Action steps🟠 Check out Bitcoin DeFi:Try Lightning Network via BreezTry RSKTry Stacks🌌 See my previous tactic How to get started on Cosmos if you missed it!",https://www.bankless.com/the-essential-guide-to-defi-on-bitcoin,2022-10-18T00:00:00.000Z,"https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/image/fetch/w_1200,h_600,c_limit,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https-3a-2f-2fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com-2fpublic-2fimages-2fa9a32c27-da38-4c08-937f-b28d4f545b13_1501x844.jpg",William M.

2283325b6b475fa5353b3e7d4477401be59639fa37ffad2ab6cda8e164e69afd,Was SBF Wrong?,3 arguments against Sam Bankman-Fried's proposed crypto regulation,,"Dear Bankless Nation, The days of the crypto wild west appear to be coming to an end. The 2021 bull-run that grew crypto grew to the point that made it impossible for regulators to ignore. They’re now scrambling to claim turf and establish their foothold within the industry. It seems that crypto regulation is inevitable. This is not necessarily a bad thing, as regulatory clarity will enable builders to operate without fear of government action while paving the way for more capital to enter the space. However, for crypto to realize its potential, it is critically important that the space fight to implement policies that preserve, rather than erode the space’s core values. Otherwise, what’s the point? We risk creating a world where DeFi is as inequitable as TradFi. This struggle between the laws of meatspace and the principles of the metaverse came to a head last week, when FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried published a piece on “Possible Digital Asset Industry Standards.” The document outlines ways in which the industry could be regulated and self-regulated on several fronts such as hack repayment, asset listings on centralized exchanges, DeFi and stablecoin regulation. There are many sensible policies in here ( knowledge-based quizzes are a good idea ). But several of SBF’s proposals also run counter to crypto's values and risk stunting crypto innovation within the US. Let’s touch on them below. 1. Sanctions, Allowlists, and Blacklists 👮 When it comes to censoring addresses, I agree with Sam that blacklists are of course preferable to allowlists. But the choice between a blacklist and allowlist is a false binary. Requiring applications and protocols to query a blacklist in order to accept transactions erodes their credible neutrality and creates a dangerous precedent in which censorship becomes normalized. Our crypto elders RSA and Erik Voorhees have great responses to this section, which SBF himself acknowledged in a recent tweet thread. All three will be on Bankless later this week to discuss this further! 📺 SBF and Erik Voorhees are joining us on Friday to chat crypto policy . Don’t miss it.","Dear Bankless Nation, The days of the crypto wild west appear to be coming to an end.The 2021 bull-run that grew crypto grew to the point that made it impossible for regulators to ignore.

Don’t miss it.2. KYC DeFi ☠️When it comes to DeFi, there’s a lot that I agree with Sam on.For example, he explicitly states that “decentralized code is speech,” and that both smart contract deployment and transaction validation should remain “permissionless and free.”However, there are some points of disagreement when it comes to his view on front-ends.For example, Sam states that:If you host a website aimed at facilitating and encouraging US retail to connect to and trade on a DEX, this may end up falling under something like a broker-dealer/FCM/etc.Which “may also potentially have KYC obligations.”But implementing KYC on front-ends runs antithetical to the DeFi ethos.Although users with the technical know-how can still interact with a protocol at the contract level, this requirement would limit DeFi’s user-base and prevent people who do not have access to financial services from using these incredibly valuable technologies.In addition, this requirement would greatly increase compliance costs for protocols and third-party front-ends such as Zapper or Zerion.Not only would this push DeFi outside of the US, but it would also make the space less resilient, as limiting the number of front-ends increases the size of honeypots for hackers while decreasing censorship-resistance.3. Stablecoin Regulation 💵In the final section of his post, Sam touches on stablecoin regulation.Once again, Sam makes several reasonable points. For instance, he advocates that USD-pegged stablecoins be backed at least 1:1 by dollars or t-bills while adhering to transparent reporting requirements.This requirement makes total sense for centrally issued, custodial stablecoins, as it mitigates risk while increasing transparency, though it is unclear whether this would apply to crypto-collateralized stablecoins such as DAI.In that vein, one point of concern is in the final paragraph, where it states that traders should be required to KYC when minting or redeeming new units:… there should be KYC of the traders participating in the on-ramp/off-ramp process (i.e., KYC of the individuals and entities creating and redeeming the stablecoin).  This is very easy to get correct - and we think there are a number of suitable regulatory frameworks under which a stablecoin program may be pursued - provided the operating entity maintains the relevant information on assets and has and enforces the proper KYC requirements.Although there is no mention of restrictions on buying stablecoins on secondary markets, this rule would still be highly exclusionary and create on-chain inequality.For example, non-KYC’d users would be unable to use their ETH as collateral to mint DAI, which limits their ability to unlock the full value of their assets.This sets a dangerous precedent because it instantiates a system of haves and have nots, rather than one which is credibly neutral in that every individual is treated the same way.In essence, it would mean that only a set of permissioned individuals could utilize the full capabilities of DeFi.An Open DialogueSBF deserves credit for being open to community input and having a discussion around these policies. He’s even already revised some of his positions following community pushback.But, if implemented, several of the proposals in his piece would erode the fundamental principles on which DeFi was built, while running the risk of stifling innovation and driving builders out of the US.Regulation is coming.But it’s of vital importance that we speak our minds so we can be sure that the policies that are put in place are the right ones.",https://www.bankless.com/was-sbf-wrong,2022-10-24T00:00:00.000Z,"https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/image/fetch/w_1200,h_600,c_limit,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https-3a-2f-2fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com-2fpublic-2fimages-2f1e7d0d75-7cd3-4346-a620-f63255ca61ef_1024x729.jpg",Ben Giove,Bankless,blog,Unknown Error,

Bankless Premium only!Intended to complement our ratings and valuation models, the Token Bible is a one-stop-shop where investors can get all the relevant information they need about each token covered, whether it be fundamentals, financials, tokenomics, and more.Rating Scale and Fair Value Estimates:Before we dive into the coverage and ratings, let’s take a moment to explain our rating scale and fair value estimates.The ratings reflect how we expect each token will perform over a six-month time horizon relative to the performance of the overall crypto-market based on market capitalization. It is not indicative of our opinion on the long-run potential of each token.The rating scale is as follows:✅ Overweight: We expect this token to outperform the broader market over the next six months.➖ Neutral: We expect this token to perform in line with the market over the next six months.❌ Underweight: We expect this token to underperform the market over the next six months.To help inform our ratings, we also provide valuation estimates for any of the applicable tokens using a discounted cash flow (DCF) model.These models aim to value each protocol's core business offerings based on the revenues it generates and its future growth prospects, which are influenced by the catalysts discussed in this report. It is not applicable to all protocols covered in the report as not all of them are generating revenue.While these models are certainly not the only factor that goes into determining a token’s rating, especially given the short-time horizon on which they are made, we view these fair value estimates as the price ceiling under which we would consider the token to be undervalued and if above, overvalued.Now that’s out of the way, let’s dive into the report.✅ OverweightThese are tokens we believe will perform in-line with the market over the next six-months.⚛️ Cosmos Hub (ATOM)Type: Ratings ChangeSector: L1Current FDV: $11.2BATOM is being upgraded from neutral to overweight.Catalyst OverviewATOM is being upgraded due to the ATOM 2.0 upgrade.ATOM 2.0 refers to a proposed series of upgrades to the tokenomics of ATOM and role of the Cosmos Hub. The upgrade includes creating what's known as the interchain scheduler, where the Cosmos Hub will be able to generate revenue from cross-chain MEV as well as the interchain allocator, where ATOM holders can allocate funds accrued by the Hub throughout the Cosmos ecosystem.The decision on whether to implement ATOM 2.0 is currently being voted on by Hub governance through Proposal #82. The proposal has yet to reach the required 40% quorum, though early votes are 96.4% in favor to just 3.6% opposed.Potential Price ImpactBy increasing utility as well as unlocking new sources of revenue, ATOM 2.0 should increase demand for and value accrual to its namesake token.Although the upgrade front-loads ATOM issuance within the first 36 months of the upgrade, this increase in inflation is likely to be somewhat offset by this newfound demand, as well from new chains using the leverage the validator set (and therefore blockspace) of the Cosmos Hub via interchain security.In addition, ATOM is likely to be used as an index token among speculators looking to get broad exposure to the Cosmos ecosystem.💱 Dopex (DPX)Type: Coverage InitiationSector: DeFi - OptionsCurrent FDV: $170MWe are initiating coverage of DPX with a rating of overweight.DPX is being assigned this rating due to the upcoming resumption of Arbitrum Odyssey and the eventual launch of the Arbitrum token.Catalyst OverviewArbitrum Odyssey is an event designed to encourage interaction with protocols that are deployed on the network. Odyssey, which was postponed in June 2022, is set to relaunch in the near future, with some suggesting a resumption will come as soon as mid-November.Given that participation is likely to lead to an airdrop allocation for an eventual Arbitrum token, the event is likely to bring a significant influx of users and liquidity onto the network.Potential Price ImpactDopex is poised to benefit from this boom in the Arbitrum economy, with capital likely to flow to the options protocols single-sided-vaults and straddles products.This, along with the launch of Atlantic Options products such as liquidation protection on GMX, is likely to increase yields for veDPX lockers, increasing the attractiveness of holding the token as lockers are entitled to a portion of protocol revenues. DPX is also likely to benefit from narrative tailwinds as a result of broader inflows into Arbitrum based projects.➖ NeutralThese are tokens we believe will perform in-line with the market over the next six-months.🏛️ dYdX (DYDX)Type: Ratings ChangeSector: DeFi - PerpetualsCurrent FDV: $1.7BDYDX is being upgraded from underweight to neutral.Catalyst OverviewDYDX is being upgraded due to the upcoming launch of dYdX V4.dYdX V4 represents a significant overhaul for the protocol, as it will transition the perpetuals exchange from running on StarkEx to its own Cosmos-based, application-specific blockchain. This chain will likely see the DYDX token be used as stake to secure the network, where stakers will accrue validator rewards, transaction fees, and MEV. DYDX V4 is slated to launch on a private testnet in Q4 2022, a public testnet in Q1 2022, and on mainnet in Q2 2022.Potential Price ImpactThe continued progression of V4 is likely to lead to improved relative strength in DYDX, as investors front-run the demand to stake the token as V4 draws closer. Furthermore, the protocol should benefit from flows into Cosmos and its related tokens as the ecosystem continues to grow in popularity among users, yield farmers, and investors.🥞 Maple Finance (MPL)Type: Ratings ChangeSector: DeFi - Undercollateralized LendingCurrent FDV: $138MMPL is being downgraded from overweight to neutral.Catalyst OverviewMPL is being downgraded due to increased competitive pressure in the under-collateralized lending sector.Despite being a market leader with $1.8B in loans since its inception, Maple is facing increasingly steep competition within the undercollateralized lending space with challengers such as TruFi, Clearpool, Ribbon Earn, dAMM Finance, and Atlendis continuing to gain traction. Because of this, it stands to reason that Maple may need to reduce fees in order to increase the attractiveness of lending and borrowing on its platform relative to that of its competitors.Potential Price ImpactAny reduction in fees as a result of competitive headwinds is likely to weigh somewhat on the performance of MPL, as 50% of protocol revenue is used to buyback and distribute MPL to xMPL stakers.This means that were revenue to decrease, there would be less buy-pressure on MPL, making it more difficult for the token to offset the sell-pressure that exists from the token being emitted through liquidity mining programs.❌ UnderweightThese are tokens we believe will underperform the market over the next six-months.🕹️ Immutable X (IMX)Type: Coverage InitiationSector: L2Current FDV: $1.3BWe are initiating coverage of IMX with a rating of underweight.Catalyst OverviewIMX is being assigned this rating due to sell-pressure from upcoming token unlocks.Immutable X is about to enter the brunt of its unlock schedule. On November 5th, 254.86M IMX (~12.7% of the total supply) is slated to be unlocked. This tranche of tokens consists of allocations for private sale investors and “project development,” and will vest linearly over 18 months and four years respectively.This increase adds fuel to an unlock fire, as $414,000 IMX tokens are currently vesting each day as a part of Immutable X’s ecosystem development fund.Potential Price ImpactThis massive unlock and subsequent vesting period may place significant sell pressure on the IMX token if early investors sell their allocations.Given that these investors are up ~520% from 2021 private rounds which saw IMX be priced at $0.10, it stands to reason that in a bear market these investors may be more inclined to sell their allocations in order to lock in returns.🃏 Illuvium (ILV)Type: Coverage InitiationSector: GameFiCurrent FDV: $644MWe are initiating coverage of Illuvium (ILV) with a rating of underweight.Catalyst OverviewILV is being assigned this rating due to sell pressure from investor unlocks.Like Immutable X, Illuvium is deep in the throes of its investor unlock schedule. There is roughly ~$523K worth of ILV that is vesting each day as a part of team and investor allocations. This vesting schedule is set to be completed in June 2025.Potential Price ImpactIlluvium’s unlocks represent a significant supply overhang for the token. Per Messari, the project's pre-seed and seed rounds were priced at $1 and $3 per ILV respectively. This means that based on the tokens current price of $62, these investors are sitting on 1966% and 6100% returns respectively.Between this and stands to reason that there is an outsized risk of investors selling tokens in order to lock in these substantial profits, thereby weighing on price.📚 Bankless Token BibleYour essential resource for leveling up on crypto tokens and analysis.Access Bankless Token Bible 👈Covered Tokens - Their ratings are as follows:UNI: Overweight ✅SYN: Overweight ✅BAL: Overweight ✅BTRFLY: Overweight ✅GMX: Overweight ✅LDO: Overweight ✅RPL: Overweight ✅AAVE: Overweight ✅RBN: Overweight ✅MATIC: Overweight ✅CRV: Neutral ➖OP: Neutral ➖INDEX: Neutral ➖SUSHI: Underweight ❌VELO: Underweight ❌SOL: Underweight ❌MKR: Underweight ❌COMP: Underweight ❌TRIBE: Underweight ❌AVAX: Underweight ❌ENS: Underweight ❌APE: Underweight ❌PERP: Underweight ❌FRAX: Underweight ❌📚 Tap into the Bankless Token Bible 👈👈Why did you get this report?Because you subscribe to Bankless and made an effort to level-up by using DeFi protocols.

The regulatory hawks of the SEC and CFTC are already circling the fresh carcass of FTX, as reported by Bloomberg.

But crypto moves at the speed of sound, and this week has been moving at Star-Wars-level lightspeed, so there have been plenty of updates since.A tldr: A CoinDesk article on November 2nd alleged that FTX’s sister hedge fund Alameda Research over-levered in holding way too much of FTX’s illiquid FTT token, and people got scared. Binance CEO CZ subsequently announced he was selling $2.1B FTT, so people got more scared and things escalated to a full-blown panic over the weekend with record withdrawals of ~$8.6B from FTX since the 10th. (See Bankless’s previous article for insight into how users and institutions rushed for the exit.)If you’d like a more visual recap in the language of The Office:This is too perfect 😂 pic.twitter.com/D9FV5mFLQI— Goomba (@im_goomba) November 11, 2022

Where does that leave us?Binance has pulled out of a potential purchase of FTX, citing reasons of “mishandled customer funds”. SBF confirmed that he lent ~$10B of funds (out of $16B) to sister hedge fund Alameda Research with the use of customer deposits, despite previous claims in a now-deleted tweet that “FTX has enough to cover all client holdings. We don’t invest client assets.”SBF filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy and resigned as FTX CEO yesterday, but not before apologizing profusely for fucking up.In response to law enforcement, Tether has frozen $46.2 million USDT on an FTX account.Justin Sun is offering a 1:1 redemption for all Tron-based assets on FTX (and no, he’s not seriously bailing out FTX).Due to regulatory pressure, FTX is also resuming withdrawals for users in the Bahamas where it’s based. Because trading on FTX hasn’t been halted, this has produced a million-dollar opportunity for users to indirectly cash out of FTX by “buying” an NFT on FTX’s NFT marketplace with their stuck funds from a KYC’d Bahamas user, which they can then off-ramp from FTX.Looks like NFTs are finally getting some of the “utility” that users were clamoring for.People now withdrawing FTX balances by buying NFTs from Bahamian accounts for six- and seven-figure amounts, buyer then gets side payment and Bahamian withdraws funds

Regulatory backlashRegulators already don’t love crypto, and this week’s events didn’t help much.The regulatory hawks of the SEC and CFTC are already circling the fresh carcass of FTX, as reported by Bloomberg.Contrary to initial expectations, American regulators are still unfortunately committed to pushing forth the SBF-championed Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act (DCCPA) bill.Washington’s resident anti-crypto senator, Elizabeth Warren, tried to capitalize politically on FTX and got shut down by Brian Armstrong.https://t.co/0HxlRiI6Sy was an offshore exchange not regulated by the SEC.

Wen Proof of Reserves? (right now)The downfall of FTX is opening a productive conversation around how the industry can improve transparency around centralized exchanges through Proof of Reserves (PoR) audits. PoR lets users verify that centralized crypto custodians actually do hold the funds they claim to hold by matching them to on-chain records, and are solvent.Here’s how PoR work:A CEX claims to hold $1B in assetsThe CEX lets a third-party auditor take a snapshot of these fundsThe auditor aggregates this snapshot into an anonymized Merkle treeThis Merkle tree is untamperable, cryptographic proof that all the funds audited at that time of the audit matches up to on-chain data.Any user can independently verify that their funds were included in the PoR auditPoR is an industry standard that has been embraced by exchanges like Kraken, BitMex and Nexo. Many exchanges are late to the game, but the FTX blowup is prompting almost all the major players like Binance, KuCoin, OKX, Poloniex and Huobi into action.1/ We are working with exchanges to display proof-of-reserves on @nansenportfolio for everyone to track their token holdings and transactions.

Here's the current list of exchange portfolios and we will live update this thread with more, so make sure you are following! 🧵— Nansen 🧭 (@nansen_ai) November 11, 2022

Don’t be misled into thinking PoR is a perfect solution however. It still requires trust in the third-party auditor. Even if auditors can be trusted, it’s also only a routine update depending on how often auditors conduct that audit. User funds that were deposited post-audit won’t be immediately updated and transparent like an on-chain transaction would be on a public blockchain.Moreover, a centralized exchange can prove that they hold all of the user's funds, but lie on the liabilities side of their balance sheet. An exchange can technically hold all of their reserves 1:1 to customer’s deposits (as it should be in theory), but their liabilities might far exceed those assets, and aren’t solvent.It’s why it’s called “Proof of Reserves”, not “Proof of Solvency”, even though the point of PoR is to try and prove solvency.The silver lining is that PoR is a huge step up from the status quo of zero transparency.If you want to eliminate all risk, move your funds to a hardware wallet. At the risk of sounding like a boomer: not your keys, not your crypto.Several exchanges contacting us last 24 hours to display proof-of-reserves.

We're happy to help (for free) - DM me if you want your exchange to be more transparent.

(Un)collateralized Lending 101First, let’s speak about the OG: collateralized lending.Everybody knows collateralized lending, a core DeFi primitive offered by various projects like Aave and Compound.Amidst recent market drawdowns, both have continued to liquidate users failing to manage collateral requirements. Despite a torrent of CeFi and neo-bank implosions, blue-chip DeFi lenders have remained solvent.Both Aave and Compound - as well as stablecoin issuers like MakerDAO - require users to fully collateralize their positions. For every $1 borrowed, at least $1 must be deposited as collateral to ensure lenders can be made whole in the event of default.If the value of a user’s collateral falls below the collateralization requirement for their position, the user is automatically liquidated by smart contracts.While these primitives empower a trustless lending and borrowing experience that allows any DeFi user to borrow capital or leverage positions, they suck from a capital efficiency standpoint.Undercollateralized (or unsecured) lending solves this problem.Have you ever taken out a massive student loan or purchased an $8 coffee on a credit card?Congratulations! You are an unsecured debtor! Borrowers of unsecured loans remain current on outstanding debt obligations, despite not pledging any collateral, as their reputation (credit score) is negatively impacted by events such as missed interest payments or loan defaults.The institutional version of a credit card is known as a line of credit (LOC) — a legally binding agreement between two or more counterparties establishing the conditions that must be met for the borrower to draw on the line and remain in compliance.This style of instrument allows the recipient to borrow without pledging any collateral to the lender. LOCs enable financial institutions to meet short-term cash needs without calling capital from investors or losing control of assets.What purpose do undercollateralized lending protocols in crypto serve?They allow TradFi institutions to borrow directly from DeFi users, instead of financial institutions or banks. The borrower and DeFi protocol work together to establish terms for the line. Users can then assess the pool’s risk/reward tradeoff and choose to deposit their own funds to the pool. At the maturity of the loan, the institution pays back any outstanding principal or accrued interest to lenders.Many different approaches exist to enable unsecured crypto lending. Some offer tiered cash flow repayment structures. Others aggregate lender funds, increasing portfolio diversification and reducing the impact of a given borrower’s default. Some allow borrowers to implement KYC/AML checks. All are attempt to satiate TradFi’s demand for undercollateralized loans.2️. Why CeFi Lenders FailedBefore we dive into the state of undercollateralized lending within DeFi, let’s touch on some of the issues with credit in CeFi. Some of these practices pushed many centralized lenders into (near) insolvency.If I could summarize the failure of CeFi lending in one phrase, it would be this: They ran a lending business, rather than a crypto lending business.CeFi lenders simply weren’t in the business of utilizing the underlying technology rails on which they operated (blockchains) within their lending and business processes.Here are a few reasons why CeFi lenders failed.Failure To Evaluate Counterparty RiskMany CeFi lenders had a poor underwriting process. For instance, in the height of the bull run, many lenders would determine a borrower's creditworthiness based on things like questionnaires or even social capital. These are incredibly shaky foundations on which to originate a loan in any industry, let alone in crypto where many institutions are unregulated and do not have audited financials.A prime example of this is the infamous “AUM Letter” from 3AC after the collapse of Terra.The transparency of blockchains would have helped tremendously with assessing counterparty risk. Rather than rely on a letter from Kyle Davies, these firms could have demanded that 3AC provide cryptographically signed messages from wallet addresses to prove they had possession of a requisite amount of funds. These firms could have also implemented covenants to restrict how funds were used, and could monitor these addresses in order to ascertain whether or not 3AC was adhering to the covenants laid out in the agreement.This is an oversimplified example, but in doing this (or something along these lines) lenders would have much more insight into 3AC’s financial position and their use of funds. These lenders could use blockchains to verify that 3AC wasn’t acting in bad faith, rather than trust their word on it.Illiquid Collateral and Poor Liquidation MechanismsAnother critical issue faced by CeFi lenders was the acceptance of poor and illiquid assets as collateral.We don’t need to look any further for evidence of this than the FTX collapse last week. Alameda Research would pledge tokens such as FTT and SRM as collateral for loans. These assets had artificially inflated fully-diluted valuations due to predatory design, as these tokens would have a very low percentage of their float circulating, which allowed Alameda to increase their borrowing capacity.In reality, these high FDVs were a complete mirage, as there was nowhere near enough liquidity in the market to support these valuations during a mass-liquidation event. That is exactly why (along with a general exodus from Sam coins) assets like FTT and SRM sold off so dramatically last week as Alameda’s collateral was liquidated and FTX imploded.But collateral quality only tells half the story. The other half are archaic liquidation processes. In CeFi, liquidations are manual (not smart contract based), meaning that lenders are at risk of taking on underwater debt positions from failing to sell depreciating collateral in a timely manner.These issues could have been somewhat mitigated were lenders to have implemented stricter standards for collateral. For instance, many DeFi protocols also utilized “bad” illiquid assets as collateral. On November 3, just days before FTX and Alameda went under, 35% of the total supply of the decentralized MIM stablecoin by Abracadabra was backed by FTT.I am probably a broken record at this point but if you really think there is a high chance of Alameda insolvency, the best trade is by far short $MIM. It is backed 35% by FTT collateral and I very much doubt it could be liquidated effectively if Alameda can't repa pic.twitter.com/bvtlR0bxWF— Spreek (@spreekaway) November 3, 2022

While MIM briefly de-pegged, the protocol has survived in large part because of its robust liquidation process. Alameda repaid all of its MIM debt, because it knew that should it fail to, their collateral liquidated without prejudice.Centralized lenders should have taken a similar approach. For example, there’s no reason why lenders could not have created a programmatic loan agreement via a smart contract that would originate a loan and liquidate a borrower's collateral should it fall below a certain LTV.A Lack of Transparency For End UsersFinally, along with poor underwriting and liquidation processes, CeFi lending platforms suffer from a grievous lack of transparency.These platforms were black boxes.Users who deposited assets into lenders like BlockFi or Celsius were given scant details about who their funds were being lent out to and where the yield they earned was derived from. When community members discovered how returns were being generated, the results were often not pretty.For instance, savvy-on-chain analysts were able to determine that Celsius deployed customer funds into risky yield farming strategies, losing tens of millions in the process due to falling victim to exploits.Users of these crypto services could not protect themselves from losses as a result of these strategies, as deposits were completely uninsured.Banks suck. It’s in our name, in case you haven’t noticed. But at least banks offer FDIC insurance to depositors. Even DeFi lenders of all ilk such as Aave, Compound, Maple, offer some sort of protection, whether it be via a token backstop or accumulated protocol reserves.3️. The Market of Undercollateralized DeFiGoldfinch, Maple Finance, and Gearbox currently dominate the undercollateralized lending space, composing 89% of the sector’s borrowing volume. The protocols examined in this guide have an aggregate outstanding loan balance of $419M, at the time of analysis.*A prior version of this article used TVL in place of borrowing volume for the above graphic and any analysis derived from itBroadly speaking, undercollateralized lending protocols can be categorized by two defining features: market niche and design.Undercollateralized lending protocols built for individual users enforce repayment via immutable smart contracts utilized to interact with whitelisted protocols. Anyone can borrow from these protocols and interact with pre-authorized dApps.Institutions, however, frequently deploy funds for market making on CEXs and may wish to use protocols that weren’t whitelisted for individual markets. This is so they can optimize the borrowing process to closely align with TradFi standards by making use of trust assumptions, giving rise to a separate category of primitives, in which underwriting serves as the basis for extending credit and is less permissionless.Let’s explore how some of the most popular protocols in the sector operate.⚙️ Protocols: Gearbox and SentimentNiche: Individual solutionsDesign: Immutable smart contractTraditional DeFi loans from Aave and Compound enable users to leverage positions via recursive borrowing: users supply ETH to borrow USDC, purchase more ETH, and borrow more USDC against their ETH loan. This process leverages the user’s position by continually borrowing against a diminishing amount of collateral.Gearbox and Sentiment give users the ability to leverage positions in a novel fashion.Instead of requiring each loan made to be overcollateralized, these protocols require users to fund an initial margin amount, after which users may borrow with up to 10x leverage (Gearbox) or up to 5x leverage (Sentiment).Minimum collateralization ratios for volatile assets of 150% or greater are common for money market and stablecoin protocols. That’s bad capital-inefficiency. Minimum collateralization ratios for Gearbox and Sentiment are 10% and 20%, respectively. Much better.But how do these protocols ensure borrowers do not simply abscond with these borrowed funds?Both require users to create an escrow wallet with the protocol. These wallets do not allow users to withdraw enough collateral to fall below collateralization requirements.Additionally, wallets are only able to interact with smart contracts specifically approved by the protocols. A hack or exploit of third-party smart contracts used for lending or yield farming activities risks leaving Gearbox or Sentiment with bad debt. To avoid this, the protocols whitelist only the most established dApps for use.⚠️ Risks: Hacks of whitelisted protocols may result in bad debt and loss of lender funds. Lenders must incorporate an assessment of potential smart contract and hack risk from all whitelisted protocols, in addition to either Gearbox or Sentiment, when evaluating their risk exposure.🥞 Protocols: Maple Finance, TrueFi, Clearpool, Goldfinch, Atlendis, and Ribbon LendNiche: Institutional solutionsDesign: Trust-Based LoanThese protocols represent the simplest solution to unsecured lending in DeFi and essentially duplicate trusted TradFi LOC environments on-chain.Potential borrowers are required to navigate a credit approval process to borrow. This process varies based on the dApp.After the completion of the credit approval process, an off-chain legally binding agreement is made between entities representing the borrower and protocol.Maple Finance has professional credit analysts stake its native token, MPL, to underwrite, negotiate, and approve loans.TrueFi expands on Maple’s approach, requiring an 80% approval of proposed loans by TRU stakers.Clearpool, Goldfinch, Atlendis, and Ribbon Lend outsource their credit checks and risk assessment processes to preapproved, third-party auditors.This relatively mature model dominates the unsecured lending sector, comprising over 84% of borrowing volume in this sector (99% if excluding Gearbox!).Institutions such as Alameda Research and Wintermute represented the primary demand source for this category of borrowing. In September, Alameda paid down over $280M in outstanding loans on Maple Finance.5/ They also had a @maplefinance pool that originated almost $300m of loans to them

But no loans are active at the moment pic.twitter.com/W2AbobxWVr— RWA.xyz (@rwa_xyz) November 8, 2022

Orthogonal Capital, a major lender to Alameda via Maple, terminated its relation with the firm shortly after the maturity of its outstanding loans, citing declining asset quality, unclear capital policies, less than robust operational and business practices, and an increasingly byzantine corporate structure.The implosion of Alameda rocked DeFi users’ faith in unsecured lending, with undercollateralized lending protocols seeing massive drawdowns in TVL in the immediate aftermath.seeing massive drops in TVL for uncollateralized lending protocols as confidence in lending to MMs drops after the FTX fiasco

in some protocols, such as maple, user deposits are locked for months, so ppl can't withdraw, which explains the smaller TVL drops pic.twitter.com/1nNPFmWUH8— 0xngmi (aggregatoor arc) (@0xngmi) November 14, 2022

⚠️ Risks: Simply put, trust. At the end of the day, you, as the lender, must have faith that the entity you are lending to will repay the loan. You must perform thorough due diligence before lending any significant amount! Do not blindly trust in the borrower’s ability to repay the obligation! This is the riskiest category of unsecured lending primitive covered in this guide!If the borrower becomes bankrupt, your claim to repayment is lumped in with every other claim to the entity’s assets. Bankruptcy proceedings, especially for highly sophisticated and extremely complex financial entities such as prop trading firms and hedge funds, are notoriously arduous and time consuming, often taking years to settle (Mt. Gox’s trustee recently notified creditors to register for repayment in July).As seen in the below image, Alameda currently has over $12M in outstanding debts on TrueFi. We believe that lenders to this fund will not be made whole and most certainly will not receive a 5.33% yield. While the impairment to value of this pool is unknown at this time, it will likely be significant.💱 Protocol: dAMMNiche: Institutional SolutionsDesign: Diversified Trust-Based LoanLaunched in September, dAMM looks to empower unsecured borrowing and lending markets for volatile assets. Prior to dAMM, institutions (specifically professional market makers) struggled to borrow the majority of crypto assets because:Existing DeFi unsecured lending primitives primarily offer stablecoin-denominated loansInstitutional lenders are wary to stray beyond mainstream assetsDeFi collateralized lending primitives require full collateralization and pose liquidation riskLending markets for small cap tokens are susceptible to flash loan exploitsSimilar to trust-based lending protocols like Maple Finance, dAMM engages a third-party auditor to underwrite potential borrowers. After successful completion of the credit assessment process, the borrower and the dAMM Foundation enter into a legally-binding loan agreement.Where dAMM differs from the trust-based lending model popularized by Maple is how it reduces risk through diversification, by aggregating lending supply and borrowing demand in pools.Any borrower can borrow any asset at the interest rate algorithmically determined by dAMM. This implies that lenders have proportional exposure to all parties borrowing their assets, based on that party’s utilization rate. By aggregating supply, lenders receive benefits from diversification: the default or bankruptcy of one borrower only jeopardizes a portion of the pool’s funds.⚠️ Risks: Similar to the trust-based loan category, lenders on dAMM are exposed to borrower default. Increasing the diversification of the borrower set, however, decreases the expected write off rate of the loan, trending towards the aggregate market default rate.Borrower diversification also presents a downside for dAMM lenders.Lending in aggregate eliminates users’ ability to select individual borrowers, forcing users to greater amounts of trust in the credit assessor and their evaluation of borrower risk. Additionally diversification benefits are negligible if a single entity comprises an outsized fraction of borrowing activity for a specific asset pool.💰 Protocol: Debt DAONiche: Institutional solutionsDesign: DeFi bondTradFi companies raise money through two sources: equity and debt financing. Equity-like financing is commonplace for DAOs and protocols, with a seemingly endless number of venture capitalists and individual investors jockey to get in on the next hottest project’s funding round or token sale (Bitcoiners don’t like this!).Debt financing for DAOs, however, is practically non-existent. It’s not hard to see why. If you can’t hold a DAO legally liable, their debt is not much assurance to a potential investor.Porter Finance previously facilitated a $3.1M convertible bond issuance for Ribbon Finance. The notes mature on December 4, 2022, with a minimum yield of 7.1%, and 384% collateralized by Ribbon Finance’s RBN token.On July 4th, less than one month after the launch of the Ribbon offering, Porter Finance announced it was shutting down its platform after the maturity of the issuance, citing a lack of confidence in the potential for “large inflows of lending demand for fixed income DeFi products, like the ones offered through Porter Finance.” The founder also noted the competitive financing rates offered by TradFi firms and a lack of institutional DeFi adoption, in addition potential underlying legal risks, as factors of the decision.The withdrawal of Porter Finance leaves Debt DAO as the major player in the DeFi-native bond issuance space. Debt DAO aims to enable protocols to raise funds for operations without liquidating treasury assets or diluting token holders.To ensure borrowers remain current on obligations, Debt DAO has pioneered the spigot, a unique smart contract which escrows a fixed percentage of protocol revenue for debt service.This contract serves the same role as “lockbox” accounts required by a traditional lender, where operating revenues flow to a designated bank account, from which the lender deducts interest or retains funds prior to receipt by the borrower.As Debt DAO underwrites borrower credit, similar to protocols in the trust-based lending category, and the spigot directly taps into protocol revenue streams, the Project can offer under or uncollateralized loans to riskier decentralized borrowers.⚠️ Risks: Debt DAO’s structure exposes lenders to both repayment and exit risk. While the spigot smart contract can escrow up to 100% of revenue, rapid decreases in the Protocol’s use could jeopardize the cash flow stream and may result in underpayment of interest. Additionally, native tokens collateralizing loans may be illiquid, and in cases where the Protocol’s ability to repay the loan comes into question, it is likely that the collateral’s value will be impaired.4️. An Optimistic Look Into An Undercollateralized FutureIf crypto is to go mainstream, the industry must provide institutional access to credit in order to onboard trillions in capital.  TradFi institutions will not enter into crypto if they need to fully collateralize everything, or will do so with capital generated off-chain.However, if the events of the past several months are any indication, the under-collateralized lending space remains a major work in progress.CeFi lenders across the industry have gone belly-up because of poor risk management.

Amidst recent market drawdowns, both have continued to liquidate users failing to manage collateral requirements. Despite a torrent of CeFi and neo-bank implosions, blue-chip DeFi lenders have remained solvent. Both Aave and Compound - as well as stablecoin issuers like MakerDAO - require users to fully collateralize their positions. For every $1 borrowed, at least $1 must be deposited as collateral to ensure lenders can be made whole in the event of default. If the value of a user’s collateral falls below the collateralization requirement for their position, the user is automatically liquidated by smart contracts.

Undercollateralized (or unsecured) lending solves this problem. Have you ever taken out a massive student loan or purchased an $8 coffee on a credit card? Congratulations! You are an unsecured debtor! Borrowers of unsecured loans remain current on outstanding debt obligations, despite not pledging any collateral, as their reputation (credit score) is negatively impacted by events such as missed interest payments or loan defaults. The institutional version of a credit card is known as a line of credit (LOC) — a legally binding agreement between two or more counterparties establishing the conditions that must be met for the borrower to draw on the line and remain in compliance. This style of instrument allows the recipient to borrow without pledging any collateral to the lender.

Some allow borrowers to implement KYC/AML checks. All are attempt to satiate TradFi’s demand for undercollateralized loans.2️. Why CeFi Lenders FailedBefore we dive into the state of undercollateralized lending within DeFi, let’s touch on some of the issues with credit in CeFi. Some of these practices pushed many centralized lenders into (near) insolvency.If I could summarize the failure of CeFi lending in one phrase, it would be this: They ran a lending business, rather than a crypto lending business.CeFi lenders simply weren’t in the business of utilizing the underlying technology rails on which they operated (blockchains) within their lending and business processes.Here are a few reasons why CeFi lenders failed.Failure To Evaluate Counterparty RiskMany CeFi lenders had a poor underwriting process. For instance, in the height of the bull run, many lenders would determine a borrower's creditworthiness based on things like questionnaires or even social capital. These are incredibly shaky foundations on which to originate a loan in any industry, let alone in crypto where many institutions are unregulated and do not have audited financials.A prime example of this is the infamous “AUM Letter” from 3AC after the collapse of Terra.The transparency of blockchains would have helped tremendously with assessing counterparty risk. Rather than rely on a letter from Kyle Davies, these firms could have demanded that 3AC provide cryptographically signed messages from wallet addresses to prove they had possession of a requisite amount of funds. These firms could have also implemented covenants to restrict how funds were used, and could monitor these addresses in order to ascertain whether or not 3AC was adhering to the covenants laid out in the agreement.This is an oversimplified example, but in doing this (or something along these lines) lenders would have much more insight into 3AC’s financial position and their use of funds. These lenders could use blockchains to verify that 3AC wasn’t acting in bad faith, rather than trust their word on it.Illiquid Collateral and Poor Liquidation MechanismsAnother critical issue faced by CeFi lenders was the acceptance of poor and illiquid assets as collateral.We don’t need to look any further for evidence of this than the FTX collapse last week. Alameda Research would pledge tokens such as FTT and SRM as collateral for loans. These assets had artificially inflated fully-diluted valuations due to predatory design, as these tokens would have a very low percentage of their float circulating, which allowed Alameda to increase their borrowing capacity.In reality, these high FDVs were a complete mirage, as there was nowhere near enough liquidity in the market to support these valuations during a mass-liquidation event. That is exactly why (along with a general exodus from Sam coins) assets like FTT and SRM sold off so dramatically last week as Alameda’s collateral was liquidated and FTX imploded.But collateral quality only tells half the story. The other half are archaic liquidation processes. In CeFi, liquidations are manual (not smart contract based), meaning that lenders are at risk of taking on underwater debt positions from failing to sell depreciating collateral in a timely manner.These issues could have been somewhat mitigated were lenders to have implemented stricter standards for collateral. For instance, many DeFi protocols also utilized “bad” illiquid assets as collateral. On November 3, just days before FTX and Alameda went under, 35% of the total supply of the decentralized MIM stablecoin by Abracadabra was backed by FTT.I am probably a broken record at this point but if you really think there is a high chance of Alameda insolvency, the best trade is by far short $MIM. It is backed 35% by FTT collateral and I very much doubt it could be liquidated effectively if Alameda can't repa pic.twitter.com/bvtlR0bxWF— Spreek (@spreekaway) November 3, 2022

While MIM briefly de-pegged, the protocol has survived in large part because of its robust liquidation process. Alameda repaid all of its MIM debt, because it knew that should it fail to, their collateral liquidated without prejudice.Centralized lenders should have taken a similar approach. For example, there’s no reason why lenders could not have created a programmatic loan agreement via a smart contract that would originate a loan and liquidate a borrower's collateral should it fall below a certain LTV.A Lack of Transparency For End UsersFinally, along with poor underwriting and liquidation processes, CeFi lending platforms suffer from a grievous lack of transparency.These platforms were black boxes.Users who deposited assets into lenders like BlockFi or Celsius were given scant details about who their funds were being lent out to and where the yield they earned was derived from. When community members discovered how returns were being generated, the results were often not pretty.For instance, savvy-on-chain analysts were able to determine that Celsius deployed customer funds into risky yield farming strategies, losing tens of millions in the process due to falling victim to exploits.Users of these crypto services could not protect themselves from losses as a result of these strategies, as deposits were completely uninsured.Banks suck. It’s in our name, in case you haven’t noticed. But at least banks offer FDIC insurance to depositors. Even DeFi lenders of all ilk such as Aave, Compound, Maple, offer some sort of protection, whether it be via a token backstop or accumulated protocol reserves.3️. The Market of Undercollateralized DeFiGoldfinch, Maple Finance, and Gearbox currently dominate the undercollateralized lending space, composing 89% of the sector’s borrowing volume. The protocols examined in this guide have an aggregate outstanding loan balance of $419M, at the time of analysis.*A prior version of this article used TVL in place of borrowing volume for the above graphic and any analysis derived from itBroadly speaking, undercollateralized lending protocols can be categorized by two defining features: market niche and design.Undercollateralized lending protocols built for individual users enforce repayment via immutable smart contracts utilized to interact with whitelisted protocols. Anyone can borrow from these protocols and interact with pre-authorized dApps.Institutions, however, frequently deploy funds for market making on CEXs and may wish to use protocols that weren’t whitelisted for individual markets. This is so they can optimize the borrowing process to closely align with TradFi standards by making use of trust assumptions, giving rise to a separate category of primitives, in which underwriting serves as the basis for extending credit and is less permissionless.Let’s explore how some of the most popular protocols in the sector operate.⚙️ Protocols: Gearbox and SentimentNiche: Individual solutionsDesign: Immutable smart contractTraditional DeFi loans from Aave and Compound enable users to leverage positions via recursive borrowing: users supply ETH to borrow USDC, purchase more ETH, and borrow more USDC against their ETH loan. This process leverages the user’s position by continually borrowing against a diminishing amount of collateral.Gearbox and Sentiment give users the ability to leverage positions in a novel fashion.Instead of requiring each loan made to be overcollateralized, these protocols require users to fund an initial margin amount, after which users may borrow with up to 10x leverage (Gearbox) or up to 5x leverage (Sentiment).Minimum collateralization ratios for volatile assets of 150% or greater are common for money market and stablecoin protocols. That’s bad capital-inefficiency. Minimum collateralization ratios for Gearbox and Sentiment are 10% and 20%, respectively. Much better.But how do these protocols ensure borrowers do not simply abscond with these borrowed funds?Both require users to create an escrow wallet with the protocol. These wallets do not allow users to withdraw enough collateral to fall below collateralization requirements.Additionally, wallets are only able to interact with smart contracts specifically approved by the protocols. A hack or exploit of third-party smart contracts used for lending or yield farming activities risks leaving Gearbox or Sentiment with bad debt. To avoid this, the protocols whitelist only the most established dApps for use.⚠️ Risks: Hacks of whitelisted protocols may result in bad debt and loss of lender funds. Lenders must incorporate an assessment of potential smart contract and hack risk from all whitelisted protocols, in addition to either Gearbox or Sentiment, when evaluating their risk exposure.🥞 Protocols: Maple Finance, TrueFi, Clearpool, Goldfinch, Atlendis, and Ribbon LendNiche: Institutional solutionsDesign: Trust-Based LoanThese protocols represent the simplest solution to unsecured lending in DeFi and essentially duplicate trusted TradFi LOC environments on-chain.Potential borrowers are required to navigate a credit approval process to borrow. This process varies based on the dApp.After the completion of the credit approval process, an off-chain legally binding agreement is made between entities representing the borrower and protocol.Maple Finance has professional credit analysts stake its native token, MPL, to underwrite, negotiate, and approve loans.TrueFi expands on Maple’s approach, requiring an 80% approval of proposed loans by TRU stakers.Clearpool, Goldfinch, Atlendis, and Ribbon Lend outsource their credit checks and risk assessment processes to preapproved, third-party auditors.This relatively mature model dominates the unsecured lending sector, comprising over 84% of borrowing volume in this sector (99% if excluding Gearbox!).Institutions such as Alameda Research and Wintermute represented the primary demand source for this category of borrowing. In September, Alameda paid down over $280M in outstanding loans on Maple Finance.5/ They also had a @maplefinance pool that originated almost $300m of loans to them

But no loans are active at the moment pic.twitter.com/W2AbobxWVr— RWA.xyz (@rwa_xyz) November 8, 2022

Orthogonal Capital, a major lender to Alameda via Maple, terminated its relation with the firm shortly after the maturity of its outstanding loans, citing declining asset quality, unclear capital policies, less than robust operational and business practices, and an increasingly byzantine corporate structure.The implosion of Alameda rocked DeFi users’ faith in unsecured lending, with undercollateralized lending protocols seeing massive drawdowns in TVL in the immediate aftermath.seeing massive drops in TVL for uncollateralized lending protocols as confidence in lending to MMs drops after the FTX fiasco

in some protocols, such as maple, user deposits are locked for months, so ppl can't withdraw, which explains the smaller TVL drops pic.twitter.com/1nNPFmWUH8— 0xngmi (aggregatoor arc) (@0xngmi) November 14, 2022

⚠️ Risks: Simply put, trust. At the end of the day, you, as the lender, must have faith that the entity you are lending to will repay the loan. You must perform thorough due diligence before lending any significant amount! Do not blindly trust in the borrower’s ability to repay the obligation! This is the riskiest category of unsecured lending primitive covered in this guide!If the borrower becomes bankrupt, your claim to repayment is lumped in with every other claim to the entity’s assets. Bankruptcy proceedings, especially for highly sophisticated and extremely complex financial entities such as prop trading firms and hedge funds, are notoriously arduous and time consuming, often taking years to settle (Mt. Gox’s trustee recently notified creditors to register for repayment in July).As seen in the below image, Alameda currently has over $12M in outstanding debts on TrueFi. We believe that lenders to this fund will not be made whole and most certainly will not receive a 5.33% yield. While the impairment to value of this pool is unknown at this time, it will likely be significant.💱 Protocol: dAMMNiche: Institutional SolutionsDesign: Diversified Trust-Based LoanLaunched in September, dAMM looks to empower unsecured borrowing and lending markets for volatile assets. Prior to dAMM, institutions (specifically professional market makers) struggled to borrow the majority of crypto assets because:Existing DeFi unsecured lending primitives primarily offer stablecoin-denominated loansInstitutional lenders are wary to stray beyond mainstream assetsDeFi collateralized lending primitives require full collateralization and pose liquidation riskLending markets for small cap tokens are susceptible to flash loan exploitsSimilar to trust-based lending protocols like Maple Finance, dAMM engages a third-party auditor to underwrite potential borrowers. After successful completion of the credit assessment process, the borrower and the dAMM Foundation enter into a legally-binding loan agreement.Where dAMM differs from the trust-based lending model popularized by Maple is how it reduces risk through diversification, by aggregating lending supply and borrowing demand in pools.Any borrower can borrow any asset at the interest rate algorithmically determined by dAMM. This implies that lenders have proportional exposure to all parties borrowing their assets, based on that party’s utilization rate. By aggregating supply, lenders receive benefits from diversification: the default or bankruptcy of one borrower only jeopardizes a portion of the pool’s funds.⚠️ Risks: Similar to the trust-based loan category, lenders on dAMM are exposed to borrower default. Increasing the diversification of the borrower set, however, decreases the expected write off rate of the loan, trending towards the aggregate market default rate.Borrower diversification also presents a downside for dAMM lenders.Lending in aggregate eliminates users’ ability to select individual borrowers, forcing users to greater amounts of trust in the credit assessor and their evaluation of borrower risk. Additionally diversification benefits are negligible if a single entity comprises an outsized fraction of borrowing activity for a specific asset pool.💰 Protocol: Debt DAONiche: Institutional solutionsDesign: DeFi bondTradFi companies raise money through two sources: equity and debt financing. Equity-like financing is commonplace for DAOs and protocols, with a seemingly endless number of venture capitalists and individual investors jockey to get in on the next hottest project’s funding round or token sale (Bitcoiners don’t like this!).Debt financing for DAOs, however, is practically non-existent. It’s not hard to see why. If you can’t hold a DAO legally liable, their debt is not much assurance to a potential investor.Porter Finance previously facilitated a $3.1M convertible bond issuance for Ribbon Finance. The notes mature on December 4, 2022, with a minimum yield of 7.1%, and 384% collateralized by Ribbon Finance’s RBN token.On July 4th, less than one month after the launch of the Ribbon offering, Porter Finance announced it was shutting down its platform after the maturity of the issuance, citing a lack of confidence in the potential for “large inflows of lending demand for fixed income DeFi products, like the ones offered through Porter Finance.” The founder also noted the competitive financing rates offered by TradFi firms and a lack of institutional DeFi adoption, in addition potential underlying legal risks, as factors of the decision.The withdrawal of Porter Finance leaves Debt DAO as the major player in the DeFi-native bond issuance space. Debt DAO aims to enable protocols to raise funds for operations without liquidating treasury assets or diluting token holders.To ensure borrowers remain current on obligations, Debt DAO has pioneered the spigot, a unique smart contract which escrows a fixed percentage of protocol revenue for debt service.This contract serves the same role as “lockbox” accounts required by a traditional lender, where operating revenues flow to a designated bank account, from which the lender deducts interest or retains funds prior to receipt by the borrower.As Debt DAO underwrites borrower credit, similar to protocols in the trust-based lending category, and the spigot directly taps into protocol revenue streams, the Project can offer under or uncollateralized loans to riskier decentralized borrowers.⚠️ Risks: Debt DAO’s structure exposes lenders to both repayment and exit risk. While the spigot smart contract can escrow up to 100% of revenue, rapid decreases in the Protocol’s use could jeopardize the cash flow stream and may result in underpayment of interest. Additionally, native tokens collateralizing loans may be illiquid, and in cases where the Protocol’s ability to repay the loan comes into question, it is likely that the collateral’s value will be impaired.4️. An Optimistic Look Into An Undercollateralized FutureIf crypto is to go mainstream, the industry must provide institutional access to credit in order to onboard trillions in capital.  TradFi institutions will not enter into crypto if they need to fully collateralize everything, or will do so with capital generated off-chain.However, if the events of the past several months are any indication, the under-collateralized lending space remains a major work in progress.CeFi lenders across the industry have gone belly-up because of poor risk management. These problems could have been mitigated had they utilized and incorporate the technology rails on which they operate (blockchains) into their business and underwriting processes.The state of undercollateralized lending in DeFi is a step in the right direction but still leaves much to be desired.The protocols which have gotten the most traction, lenders like Maple, TruFi, and Clearpool offer improved transparency relative to their centralized incumbents but still fail to provide lenders with strong repayment guarantees and insight into finances of counterparties whose books reside off-chain.Protocols like Gearbox and Sentiment improve on this model by enforcing loan covenants via smart contracts, as borrowers must maintain a minimum collateral ratio while only being able to utilize funds in whitelisted protocols.DeFi bond protocols which offer more traditional forms of credit like Debt DAO represent a step in the right direction as well, as like Gearbox and Sentiment, they enforce repayment via smart contracts while providing credit to on-chain entities (DAOs) whose financial position can be audited 24/7/365.If you provide credit, there will be defaults. Over the next few cycles, there will be more FTX-sized entities that will become over-leveraged and go under. It’s a part of the game, and lenders are compensated for this risk by being able to charge higher borrow rates.However, by utilizing crypto-rails to increase transparency, minimize counterparty risk, automate repayment and liquidations, and enforce covenants via smart contracts, it will become far easier to identify and mitigate risks before they become systemic.Action steps📖 Read William Peaster’s previous guide on how to lend crypto to institutions📖 Read Donovan’s Monday article: FTX is why we need more DeFi, not less",https://www.bankless.com/ultimate-guide-to-undercollateralized-lending-in-defi,,https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/2022/11/e09d7bcb-503e-4de2-bcbe-53b78223d7ec_2667x1500.webp,Ben Giove,Bankless,blog,Unknown Error,

These lenders could use blockchains to verify that 3AC wasn’t acting in bad faith, rather than trust their word on it.Illiquid Collateral and Poor Liquidation MechanismsAnother critical issue faced by CeFi lenders was the acceptance of poor and illiquid assets as collateral.We don’t need to look any further for evidence of this than the FTX collapse last week. Alameda Research would pledge tokens such as FTT and SRM as collateral for loans. These assets had artificially inflated fully-diluted valuations due to predatory design, as these tokens would have a very low percentage of their float circulating, which allowed Alameda to increase their borrowing capacity.In reality, these high FDVs were a complete mirage, as there was nowhere near enough liquidity in the market to support these valuations during a mass-liquidation event. That is exactly why (along with a general exodus from Sam coins) assets like FTT and SRM sold off so dramatically last week as Alameda’s collateral was liquidated and FTX imploded.But collateral quality only tells half the story. The other half are archaic liquidation processes. In CeFi, liquidations are manual (not smart contract based), meaning that lenders are at risk of taking on underwater debt positions from failing to sell depreciating collateral in a timely manner.These issues could have been somewhat mitigated were lenders to have implemented stricter standards for collateral. For instance, many DeFi protocols also utilized “bad” illiquid assets as collateral. On November 3, just days before FTX and Alameda went under, 35% of the total supply of the decentralized MIM stablecoin by Abracadabra was backed by FTT.I am probably a broken record at this point but if you really think there is a high chance of Alameda insolvency, the best trade is by far short $MIM. It is backed 35% by FTT collateral and I very much doubt it could be liquidated effectively if Alameda can't repa pic.twitter.com/bvtlR0bxWF— Spreek (@spreekaway) November 3, 2022

While MIM briefly de-pegged, the protocol has survived in large part because of its robust liquidation process. Alameda repaid all of its MIM debt, because it knew that should it fail to, their collateral liquidated without prejudice.Centralized lenders should have taken a similar approach. For example, there’s no reason why lenders could not have created a programmatic loan agreement via a smart contract that would originate a loan and liquidate a borrower's collateral should it fall below a certain LTV.A Lack of Transparency For End UsersFinally, along with poor underwriting and liquidation processes, CeFi lending platforms suffer from a grievous lack of transparency.These platforms were black boxes.Users who deposited assets into lenders like BlockFi or Celsius were given scant details about who their funds were being lent out to and where the yield they earned was derived from. When community members discovered how returns were being generated, the results were often not pretty.For instance, savvy-on-chain analysts were able to determine that Celsius deployed customer funds into risky yield farming strategies, losing tens of millions in the process due to falling victim to exploits.Users of these crypto services could not protect themselves from losses as a result of these strategies, as deposits were completely uninsured.Banks suck. It’s in our name, in case you haven’t noticed. But at least banks offer FDIC insurance to depositors. Even DeFi lenders of all ilk such as Aave, Compound, Maple, offer some sort of protection, whether it be via a token backstop or accumulated protocol reserves.3️. The Market of Undercollateralized DeFiGoldfinch, Maple Finance, and Gearbox currently dominate the undercollateralized lending space, composing 89% of the sector’s borrowing volume. The protocols examined in this guide have an aggregate outstanding loan balance of $419M, at the time of analysis.*A prior version of this article used TVL in place of borrowing volume for the above graphic and any analysis derived from itBroadly speaking, undercollateralized lending protocols can be categorized by two defining features: market niche and design.Undercollateralized lending protocols built for individual users enforce repayment via immutable smart contracts utilized to interact with whitelisted protocols. Anyone can borrow from these protocols and interact with pre-authorized dApps.Institutions, however, frequently deploy funds for market making on CEXs and may wish to use protocols that weren’t whitelisted for individual markets. This is so they can optimize the borrowing process to closely align with TradFi standards by making use of trust assumptions, giving rise to a separate category of primitives, in which underwriting serves as the basis for extending credit and is less permissionless.Let’s explore how some of the most popular protocols in the sector operate.⚙️ Protocols: Gearbox and SentimentNiche: Individual solutionsDesign: Immutable smart contractTraditional DeFi loans from Aave and Compound enable users to leverage positions via recursive borrowing: users supply ETH to borrow USDC, purchase more ETH, and borrow more USDC against their ETH loan. This process leverages the user’s position by continually borrowing against a diminishing amount of collateral.Gearbox and Sentiment give users the ability to leverage positions in a novel fashion.Instead of requiring each loan made to be overcollateralized, these protocols require users to fund an initial margin amount, after which users may borrow with up to 10x leverage (Gearbox) or up to 5x leverage (Sentiment).Minimum collateralization ratios for volatile assets of 150% or greater are common for money market and stablecoin protocols. That’s bad capital-inefficiency. Minimum collateralization ratios for Gearbox and Sentiment are 10% and 20%, respectively. Much better.But how do these protocols ensure borrowers do not simply abscond with these borrowed funds?Both require users to create an escrow wallet with the protocol. These wallets do not allow users to withdraw enough collateral to fall below collateralization requirements.Additionally, wallets are only able to interact with smart contracts specifically approved by the protocols. A hack or exploit of third-party smart contracts used for lending or yield farming activities risks leaving Gearbox or Sentiment with bad debt. To avoid this, the protocols whitelist only the most established dApps for use.⚠️ Risks: Hacks of whitelisted protocols may result in bad debt and loss of lender funds. Lenders must incorporate an assessment of potential smart contract and hack risk from all whitelisted protocols, in addition to either Gearbox or Sentiment, when evaluating their risk exposure.🥞 Protocols: Maple Finance, TrueFi, Clearpool, Goldfinch, Atlendis, and Ribbon LendNiche: Institutional solutionsDesign: Trust-Based LoanThese protocols represent the simplest solution to unsecured lending in DeFi and essentially duplicate trusted TradFi LOC environments on-chain.Potential borrowers are required to navigate a credit approval process to borrow. This process varies based on the dApp.After the completion of the credit approval process, an off-chain legally binding agreement is made between entities representing the borrower and protocol.Maple Finance has professional credit analysts stake its native token, MPL, to underwrite, negotiate, and approve loans.TrueFi expands on Maple’s approach, requiring an 80% approval of proposed loans by TRU stakers.Clearpool, Goldfinch, Atlendis, and Ribbon Lend outsource their credit checks and risk assessment processes to preapproved, third-party auditors.This relatively mature model dominates the unsecured lending sector, comprising over 84% of borrowing volume in this sector (99% if excluding Gearbox!).Institutions such as Alameda Research and Wintermute represented the primary demand source for this category of borrowing.

⚠️ Risks: Simply put, trust. At the end of the day, you, as the lender, must have faith that the entity you are lending to will repay the loan. You must perform thorough due diligence before lending any significant amount! Do not blindly trust in the borrower’s ability to repay the obligation! This is the riskiest category of unsecured lending primitive covered in this guide!If the borrower becomes bankrupt, your claim to repayment is lumped in with every other claim to the entity’s assets. Bankruptcy proceedings, especially for highly sophisticated and extremely complex financial entities such as prop trading firms and hedge funds, are notoriously arduous and time consuming, often taking years to settle (Mt. Gox’s trustee recently notified creditors to register for repayment in July).As seen in the below image, Alameda currently has over $12M in outstanding debts on TrueFi. We believe that lenders to this fund will not be made whole and most certainly will not receive a 5.33% yield. While the impairment to value of this pool is unknown at this time, it will likely be significant.💱 Protocol: dAMMNiche: Institutional SolutionsDesign: Diversified Trust-Based LoanLaunched in September, dAMM looks to empower unsecured borrowing and lending markets for volatile assets. Prior to dAMM, institutions (specifically professional market makers) struggled to borrow the majority of crypto assets because:Existing DeFi unsecured lending primitives primarily offer stablecoin-denominated loansInstitutional lenders are wary to stray beyond mainstream assetsDeFi collateralized lending primitives require full collateralization and pose liquidation riskLending markets for small cap tokens are susceptible to flash loan exploitsSimilar to trust-based lending protocols like Maple Finance, dAMM engages a third-party auditor to underwrite potential borrowers. After successful completion of the credit assessment process, the borrower and the dAMM Foundation enter into a legally-binding loan agreement.Where dAMM differs from the trust-based lending model popularized by Maple is how it reduces risk through diversification, by aggregating lending supply and borrowing demand in pools.Any borrower can borrow any asset at the interest rate algorithmically determined by dAMM. This implies that lenders have proportional exposure to all parties borrowing their assets, based on that party’s utilization rate. By aggregating supply, lenders receive benefits from diversification: the default or bankruptcy of one borrower only jeopardizes a portion of the pool’s funds.⚠️ Risks: Similar to the trust-based loan category, lenders on dAMM are exposed to borrower default. Increasing the diversification of the borrower set, however, decreases the expected write off rate of the loan, trending towards the aggregate market default rate.Borrower diversification also presents a downside for dAMM lenders.Lending in aggregate eliminates users’ ability to select individual borrowers, forcing users to greater amounts of trust in the credit assessor and their evaluation of borrower risk. Additionally diversification benefits are negligible if a single entity comprises an outsized fraction of borrowing activity for a specific asset pool.💰 Protocol: Debt DAONiche: Institutional solutionsDesign: DeFi bondTradFi companies raise money through two sources: equity and debt financing. Equity-like financing is commonplace for DAOs and protocols, with a seemingly endless number of venture capitalists and individual investors jockey to get in on the next hottest project’s funding round or token sale (Bitcoiners don’t like this!).Debt financing for DAOs, however, is practically non-existent. It’s not hard to see why. If you can’t hold a DAO legally liable, their debt is not much assurance to a potential investor.Porter Finance previously facilitated a $3.1M convertible bond issuance for Ribbon Finance. The notes mature on December 4, 2022, with a minimum yield of 7.1%, and 384% collateralized by Ribbon Finance’s RBN token.On July 4th, less than one month after the launch of the Ribbon offering, Porter Finance announced it was shutting down its platform after the maturity of the issuance, citing a lack of confidence in the potential for “large inflows of lending demand for fixed income DeFi products, like the ones offered through Porter Finance.” The founder also noted the competitive financing rates offered by TradFi firms and a lack of institutional DeFi adoption, in addition potential underlying legal risks, as factors of the decision.The withdrawal of Porter Finance leaves Debt DAO as the major player in the DeFi-native bond issuance space. Debt DAO aims to enable protocols to raise funds for operations without liquidating treasury assets or diluting token holders.To ensure borrowers remain current on obligations, Debt DAO has pioneered the spigot, a unique smart contract which escrows a fixed percentage of protocol revenue for debt service.This contract serves the same role as “lockbox” accounts required by a traditional lender, where operating revenues flow to a designated bank account, from which the lender deducts interest or retains funds prior to receipt by the borrower.As Debt DAO underwrites borrower credit, similar to protocols in the trust-based lending category, and the spigot directly taps into protocol revenue streams, the Project can offer under or uncollateralized loans to riskier decentralized borrowers.⚠️ Risks: Debt DAO’s structure exposes lenders to both repayment and exit risk. While the spigot smart contract can escrow up to 100% of revenue, rapid decreases in the Protocol’s use could jeopardize the cash flow stream and may result in underpayment of interest. Additionally, native tokens collateralizing loans may be illiquid, and in cases where the Protocol’s ability to repay the loan comes into question, it is likely that the collateral’s value will be impaired.4️. An Optimistic Look Into An Undercollateralized FutureIf crypto is to go mainstream, the industry must provide institutional access to credit in order to onboard trillions in capital.  TradFi institutions will not enter into crypto if they need to fully collateralize everything, or will do so with capital generated off-chain.However, if the events of the past several months are any indication, the under-collateralized lending space remains a major work in progress.CeFi lenders across the industry have gone belly-up because of poor risk management. These problems could have been mitigated had they utilized and incorporate the technology rails on which they operate (blockchains) into their business and underwriting processes.The state of undercollateralized lending in DeFi is a step in the right direction but still leaves much to be desired.The protocols which have gotten the most traction, lenders like Maple, TruFi, and Clearpool offer improved transparency relative to their centralized incumbents but still fail to provide lenders with strong repayment guarantees and insight into finances of counterparties whose books reside off-chain.Protocols like Gearbox and Sentiment improve on this model by enforcing loan covenants via smart contracts, as borrowers must maintain a minimum collateral ratio while only being able to utilize funds in whitelisted protocols.DeFi bond protocols which offer more traditional forms of credit like Debt DAO represent a step in the right direction as well, as like Gearbox and Sentiment, they enforce repayment via smart contracts while providing credit to on-chain entities (DAOs) whose financial position can be audited 24/7/365.If you provide credit, there will be defaults. Over the next few cycles, there will be more FTX-sized entities that will become over-leveraged and go under. It’s a part of the game, and lenders are compensated for this risk by being able to charge higher borrow rates.However, by utilizing crypto-rails to increase transparency, minimize counterparty risk, automate repayment and liquidations, and enforce covenants via smart contracts, it will become far easier to identify and mitigate risks before they become systemic.Action steps📖 Read William Peaster’s previous guide on how to lend crypto to institutions📖 Read Donovan’s Monday article: FTX is why we need more DeFi, not less",https://www.bankless.com/ultimate-guide-to-undercollateralized-lending-in-defi,,https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/2022/11/e09d7bcb-503e-4de2-bcbe-53b78223d7ec_2667x1500.webp,Ben Giove,Bankless,blog,Unknown Error,

The Fed can’t default, so they become “secured”. If issued by commercial banks, they rely on rating agencies like Moodys or S&P to determine borrower creditworthiness.DeFi has neither of these tools in their arsenal.Yet, a whole slew of protocols like Maple Finance, Gearbox and TrueFi are already doing it.Even TradFi institutions like FTX & Alameda were huge borrowers in this DeFi market! 🤯How does the world of DeFi govern this risky sector through blockchains and smart contracts?Today’s newsletter is everything you need to know about DeFi undercollateralized lending in one read, brought to you by Bankless analysts Ben and Jack.- Bankless teamWRITER WEDNESDAYSBankless Writers: Ben Giove, Bankless Analyst; Jack Inabinet, Bankless InternThe Ultimate Guide to DeFi Undercollateralized Lending“Undercollateralized” is a dirty phrase in the crypto industry.I'm sure next cycle's big crypto market panic will be because of undercollateralized lending. It can only really end one way— Ayu Ayu (@SSnuffalupagus) October 14, 2022

From Voyager and Celsius to FTX, this common practice among TradFi institutions has left a wake of insolvency and devastation in its path. Centralized crypto lenders recklessly extended credit to various crypto funds (3AC, Alameda, and others), with the promise of a nice yield that they could pass along to their users, in return.Unfortunately, as these crypto banks have recently learned, the vision for a trade or investment that you lay out in a nice pro forma doesn’t always materialize.We recognize your hesitance to embrace this form of lending, anon, and I hope that this guide may serve in your venture to find the light at the end of a very, very dark unsecured lending tunnel.This article is broken into four main sections:(Un)collateralized Lending 101Why CeFi Lenders FailedThe Market of Undercollateralized DeFiIndividual SolutionsImmutable smart contracts (Gearbox, Sentiment)Institutional SolutionsTrust-based loans (Maple Finance, TrueFi, Clearpool, Goldfinch, Atlendis, and Ribbon Lend)Diversified trust-based loans (dAMM)DeFi bonds (Debt DAO)An Optimistic Look Into A Undercollateralized Future1️. (Un)collateralized Lending 101First, let’s speak about the OG: collateralized lending.Everybody knows collateralized lending, a core DeFi primitive offered by various projects like Aave and Compound.Amidst recent market drawdowns, both have continued to liquidate users failing to manage collateral requirements. Despite a torrent of CeFi and neo-bank implosions, blue-chip DeFi lenders have remained solvent.Both Aave and Compound - as well as stablecoin issuers like MakerDAO - require users to fully collateralize their positions. For every $1 borrowed, at least $1 must be deposited as collateral to ensure lenders can be made whole in the event of default.If the value of a user’s collateral falls below the collateralization requirement for their position, the user is automatically liquidated by smart contracts.While these primitives empower a trustless lending and borrowing experience that allows any DeFi user to borrow capital or leverage positions, they suck from a capital efficiency standpoint.Undercollateralized (or unsecured) lending solves this problem.Have you ever taken out a massive student loan or purchased an $8 coffee on a credit card?Congratulations! You are an unsecured debtor! Borrowers of unsecured loans remain current on outstanding debt obligations, despite not pledging any collateral, as their reputation (credit score) is negatively impacted by events such as missed interest payments or loan defaults.The institutional version of a credit card is known as a line of credit (LOC) — a legally binding agreement between two or more counterparties establishing the conditions that must be met for the borrower to draw on the line and remain in compliance.This style of instrument allows the recipient to borrow without pledging any collateral to the lender. LOCs enable financial institutions to meet short-term cash needs without calling capital from investors or losing control of assets.What purpose do undercollateralized lending protocols in crypto serve?They allow TradFi institutions to borrow directly from DeFi users, instead of financial institutions or banks. The borrower and DeFi protocol work together to establish terms for the line. Users can then assess the pool’s risk/reward tradeoff and choose to deposit their own funds to the pool. At the maturity of the loan, the institution pays back any outstanding principal or accrued interest to lenders.Many different approaches exist to enable unsecured crypto lending. Some offer tiered cash flow repayment structures. Others aggregate lender funds, increasing portfolio diversification and reducing the impact of a given borrower’s default. Some allow borrowers to implement KYC/AML checks. All are attempt to satiate TradFi’s demand for undercollateralized loans.2️. Why CeFi Lenders FailedBefore we dive into the state of undercollateralized lending within DeFi, let’s touch on some of the issues with credit in CeFi. Some of these practices pushed many centralized lenders into (near) insolvency.If I could summarize the failure of CeFi lending in one phrase, it would be this: They ran a lending business, rather than a crypto lending business.CeFi lenders simply weren’t in the business of utilizing the underlying technology rails on which they operated (blockchains) within their lending and business processes.Here are a few reasons why CeFi lenders failed.Failure To Evaluate Counterparty RiskMany CeFi lenders had a poor underwriting process. For instance, in the height of the bull run, many lenders would determine a borrower's creditworthiness based on things like questionnaires or even social capital. These are incredibly shaky foundations on which to originate a loan in any industry, let alone in crypto where many institutions are unregulated and do not have audited financials.A prime example of this is the infamous “AUM Letter” from 3AC after the collapse of Terra.The transparency of blockchains would have helped tremendously with assessing counterparty risk. Rather than rely on a letter from Kyle Davies, these firms could have demanded that 3AC provide cryptographically signed messages from wallet addresses to prove they had possession of a requisite amount of funds. These firms could have also implemented covenants to restrict how funds were used, and could monitor these addresses in order to ascertain whether or not 3AC was adhering to the covenants laid out in the agreement.This is an oversimplified example, but in doing this (or something along these lines) lenders would have much more insight into 3AC’s financial position and their use of funds. These lenders could use blockchains to verify that 3AC wasn’t acting in bad faith, rather than trust their word on it.Illiquid Collateral and Poor Liquidation MechanismsAnother critical issue faced by CeFi lenders was the acceptance of poor and illiquid assets as collateral.We don’t need to look any further for evidence of this than the FTX collapse last week.

By aggregating supply, lenders receive benefits from diversification: the default or bankruptcy of one borrower only jeopardizes a portion of the pool’s funds.⚠️ Risks: Similar to the trust-based loan category, lenders on dAMM are exposed to borrower default. Increasing the diversification of the borrower set, however, decreases the expected write off rate of the loan, trending towards the aggregate market default rate.Borrower diversification also presents a downside for dAMM lenders.Lending in aggregate eliminates users’ ability to select individual borrowers, forcing users to greater amounts of trust in the credit assessor and their evaluation of borrower risk. Additionally diversification benefits are negligible if a single entity comprises an outsized fraction of borrowing activity for a specific asset pool.💰 Protocol: Debt DAONiche: Institutional solutionsDesign: DeFi bondTradFi companies raise money through two sources: equity and debt financing. Equity-like financing is commonplace for DAOs and protocols, with a seemingly endless number of venture capitalists and individual investors jockey to get in on the next hottest project’s funding round or token sale (Bitcoiners don’t like this!).Debt financing for DAOs, however, is practically non-existent. It’s not hard to see why. If you can’t hold a DAO legally liable, their debt is not much assurance to a potential investor.Porter Finance previously facilitated a $3.1M convertible bond issuance for Ribbon Finance. The notes mature on December 4, 2022, with a minimum yield of 7.1%, and 384% collateralized by Ribbon Finance’s RBN token.On July 4th, less than one month after the launch of the Ribbon offering, Porter Finance announced it was shutting down its platform after the maturity of the issuance, citing a lack of confidence in the potential for “large inflows of lending demand for fixed income DeFi products, like the ones offered through Porter Finance.” The founder also noted the competitive financing rates offered by TradFi firms and a lack of institutional DeFi adoption, in addition potential underlying legal risks, as factors of the decision.The withdrawal of Porter Finance leaves Debt DAO as the major player in the DeFi-native bond issuance space. Debt DAO aims to enable protocols to raise funds for operations without liquidating treasury assets or diluting token holders.To ensure borrowers remain current on obligations, Debt DAO has pioneered the spigot, a unique smart contract which escrows a fixed percentage of protocol revenue for debt service.This contract serves the same role as “lockbox” accounts required by a traditional lender, where operating revenues flow to a designated bank account, from which the lender deducts interest or retains funds prior to receipt by the borrower.As Debt DAO underwrites borrower credit, similar to protocols in the trust-based lending category, and the spigot directly taps into protocol revenue streams, the Project can offer under or uncollateralized loans to riskier decentralized borrowers.⚠️ Risks: Debt DAO’s structure exposes lenders to both repayment and exit risk. While the spigot smart contract can escrow up to 100% of revenue, rapid decreases in the Protocol’s use could jeopardize the cash flow stream and may result in underpayment of interest. Additionally, native tokens collateralizing loans may be illiquid, and in cases where the Protocol’s ability to repay the loan comes into question, it is likely that the collateral’s value will be impaired.4️. An Optimistic Look Into An Undercollateralized FutureIf crypto is to go mainstream, the industry must provide institutional access to credit in order to onboard trillions in capital.  TradFi institutions will not enter into crypto if they need to fully collateralize everything, or will do so with capital generated off-chain.However, if the events of the past several months are any indication, the under-collateralized lending space remains a major work in progress.CeFi lenders across the industry have gone belly-up because of poor risk management. These problems could have been mitigated had they utilized and incorporate the technology rails on which they operate (blockchains) into their business and underwriting processes.The state of undercollateralized lending in DeFi is a step in the right direction but still leaves much to be desired.The protocols which have gotten the most traction, lenders like Maple, TruFi, and Clearpool offer improved transparency relative to their centralized incumbents but still fail to provide lenders with strong repayment guarantees and insight into finances of counterparties whose books reside off-chain.Protocols like Gearbox and Sentiment improve on this model by enforcing loan covenants via smart contracts, as borrowers must maintain a minimum collateral ratio while only being able to utilize funds in whitelisted protocols.DeFi bond protocols which offer more traditional forms of credit like Debt DAO represent a step in the right direction as well, as like Gearbox and Sentiment, they enforce repayment via smart contracts while providing credit to on-chain entities (DAOs) whose financial position can be audited 24/7/365.If you provide credit, there will be defaults. Over the next few cycles, there will be more FTX-sized entities that will become over-leveraged and go under. It’s a part of the game, and lenders are compensated for this risk by being able to charge higher borrow rates.However, by utilizing crypto-rails to increase transparency, minimize counterparty risk, automate repayment and liquidations, and enforce covenants via smart contracts, it will become far easier to identify and mitigate risks before they become systemic.Action steps📖 Read William Peaster’s previous guide on how to lend crypto to institutions📖 Read Donovan’s Monday article: FTX is why we need more DeFi, not less",https://www.bankless.com/ultimate-guide-to-undercollateralized-lending-in-defi,,https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/2022/11/e09d7bcb-503e-4de2-bcbe-53b78223d7ec_2667x1500.webp,Ben Giove,Bankless,blog,Unknown Error,

From Voyager and Celsius to FTX, this common practice among TradFi institutions has left a wake of insolvency and devastation in its path. Centralized crypto lenders recklessly extended credit to various crypto funds (3AC, Alameda, and others), with the promise of a nice yield that they could pass along to their users, in return.Unfortunately, as these crypto banks have recently learned, the vision for a trade or investment that you lay out in a nice pro forma doesn’t always materialize.We recognize your hesitance to embrace this form of lending, anon, and I hope that this guide may serve in your venture to find the light at the end of a very, very dark unsecured lending tunnel.This article is broken into four main sections:(Un)collateralized Lending 101Why CeFi Lenders FailedThe Market of Undercollateralized DeFiIndividual SolutionsImmutable smart contracts (Gearbox, Sentiment)Institutional SolutionsTrust-based loans (Maple Finance, TrueFi, Clearpool, Goldfinch, Atlendis, and Ribbon Lend)Diversified trust-based loans (dAMM)DeFi bonds (Debt DAO)An Optimistic Look Into A Undercollateralized Future1️. (Un)collateralized Lending 101First, let’s speak about the OG: collateralized lending.Everybody knows collateralized lending, a core DeFi primitive offered by various projects like Aave and Compound.Amidst recent market drawdowns, both have continued to liquidate users failing to manage collateral requirements. Despite a torrent of CeFi and neo-bank implosions, blue-chip DeFi lenders have remained solvent.Both Aave and Compound - as well as stablecoin issuers like MakerDAO - require users to fully collateralize their positions. For every $1 borrowed, at least $1 must be deposited as collateral to ensure lenders can be made whole in the event of default.If the value of a user’s collateral falls below the collateralization requirement for their position, the user is automatically liquidated by smart contracts.While these primitives empower a trustless lending and borrowing experience that allows any DeFi user to borrow capital or leverage positions, they suck from a capital efficiency standpoint.Undercollateralized (or unsecured) lending solves this problem.Have you ever taken out a massive student loan or purchased an $8 coffee on a credit card?Congratulations! You are an unsecured debtor! Borrowers of unsecured loans remain current on outstanding debt obligations, despite not pledging any collateral, as their reputation (credit score) is negatively impacted by events such as missed interest payments or loan defaults.The institutional version of a credit card is known as a line of credit (LOC) — a legally binding agreement between two or more counterparties establishing the conditions that must be met for the borrower to draw on the line and remain in compliance.This style of instrument allows the recipient to borrow without pledging any collateral to the lender. LOCs enable financial institutions to meet short-term cash needs without calling capital from investors or losing control of assets.What purpose do undercollateralized lending protocols in crypto serve?They allow TradFi institutions to borrow directly from DeFi users, instead of financial institutions or banks. The borrower and DeFi protocol work together to establish terms for the line. Users can then assess the pool’s risk/reward tradeoff and choose to deposit their own funds to the pool. At the maturity of the loan, the institution pays back any outstanding principal or accrued interest to lenders.Many different approaches exist to enable unsecured crypto lending. Some offer tiered cash flow repayment structures. Others aggregate lender funds, increasing portfolio diversification and reducing the impact of a given borrower’s default. Some allow borrowers to implement KYC/AML checks. All are attempt to satiate TradFi’s demand for undercollateralized loans.2️. Why CeFi Lenders FailedBefore we dive into the state of undercollateralized lending within DeFi, let’s touch on some of the issues with credit in CeFi. Some of these practices pushed many centralized lenders into (near) insolvency.If I could summarize the failure of CeFi lending in one phrase, it would be this: They ran a lending business, rather than a crypto lending business.CeFi lenders simply weren’t in the business of utilizing the underlying technology rails on which they operated (blockchains) within their lending and business processes.Here are a few reasons why CeFi lenders failed.Failure To Evaluate Counterparty RiskMany CeFi lenders had a poor underwriting process. For instance, in the height of the bull run, many lenders would determine a borrower's creditworthiness based on things like questionnaires or even social capital. These are incredibly shaky foundations on which to originate a loan in any industry, let alone in crypto where many institutions are unregulated and do not have audited financials.A prime example of this is the infamous “AUM Letter” from 3AC after the collapse of Terra.The transparency of blockchains would have helped tremendously with assessing counterparty risk. Rather than rely on a letter from Kyle Davies, these firms could have demanded that 3AC provide cryptographically signed messages from wallet addresses to prove they had possession of a requisite amount of funds. These firms could have also implemented covenants to restrict how funds were used, and could monitor these addresses in order to ascertain whether or not 3AC was adhering to the covenants laid out in the agreement.This is an oversimplified example, but in doing this (or something along these lines) lenders would have much more insight into 3AC’s financial position and their use of funds. These lenders could use blockchains to verify that 3AC wasn’t acting in bad faith, rather than trust their word on it.Illiquid Collateral and Poor Liquidation MechanismsAnother critical issue faced by CeFi lenders was the acceptance of poor and illiquid assets as collateral.We don’t need to look any further for evidence of this than the FTX collapse last week. Alameda Research would pledge tokens such as FTT and SRM as collateral for loans. These assets had artificially inflated fully-diluted valuations due to predatory design, as these tokens would have a very low percentage of their float circulating, which allowed Alameda to increase their borrowing capacity.In reality, these high FDVs were a complete mirage, as there was nowhere near enough liquidity in the market to support these valuations during a mass-liquidation event. That is exactly why (along with a general exodus from Sam coins) assets like FTT and SRM sold off so dramatically last week as Alameda’s collateral was liquidated and FTX imploded.But collateral quality only tells half the story. The other half are archaic liquidation processes. In CeFi, liquidations are manual (not smart contract based), meaning that lenders are at risk of taking on underwater debt positions from failing to sell depreciating collateral in a timely manner.These issues could have been somewhat mitigated were lenders to have implemented stricter standards for collateral. For instance, many DeFi protocols also utilized “bad” illiquid assets as collateral. On November 3, just days before FTX and Alameda went under, 35% of the total supply of the decentralized MIM stablecoin by Abracadabra was backed by FTT.I am probably a broken record at this point but if you really think there is a high chance of Alameda insolvency, the best trade is by far short $MIM. It is backed 35% by FTT collateral and I very much doubt it could be liquidated effectively if Alameda can't repa pic.twitter.com/bvtlR0bxWF— Spreek (@spreekaway) November 3, 2022

While MIM briefly de-pegged, the protocol has survived in large part because of its robust liquidation process. Alameda repaid all of its MIM debt, because it knew that should it fail to, their collateral liquidated without prejudice.Centralized lenders should have taken a similar approach. For example, there’s no reason why lenders could not have created a programmatic loan agreement via a smart contract that would originate a loan and liquidate a borrower's collateral should it fall below a certain LTV.A Lack of Transparency For End UsersFinally, along with poor underwriting and liquidation processes, CeFi lending platforms suffer from a grievous lack of transparency.These platforms were black boxes.Users who deposited assets into lenders like BlockFi or Celsius were given scant details about who their funds were being lent out to and where the yield they earned was derived from. When community members discovered how returns were being generated, the results were often not pretty.For instance, savvy-on-chain analysts were able to determine that Celsius deployed customer funds into risky yield farming strategies, losing tens of millions in the process due to falling victim to exploits.Users of these crypto services could not protect themselves from losses as a result of these strategies, as deposits were completely uninsured.Banks suck. It’s in our name, in case you haven’t noticed. But at least banks offer FDIC insurance to depositors.

The protocols examined in this guide have an aggregate outstanding loan balance of $419M, at the time of analysis.*A prior version of this article used TVL in place of borrowing volume for the above graphic and any analysis derived from itBroadly speaking, undercollateralized lending protocols can be categorized by two defining features: market niche and design.Undercollateralized lending protocols built for individual users enforce repayment via immutable smart contracts utilized to interact with whitelisted protocols. Anyone can borrow from these protocols and interact with pre-authorized dApps.Institutions, however, frequently deploy funds for market making on CEXs and may wish to use protocols that weren’t whitelisted for individual markets. This is so they can optimize the borrowing process to closely align with TradFi standards by making use of trust assumptions, giving rise to a separate category of primitives, in which underwriting serves as the basis for extending credit and is less permissionless.Let’s explore how some of the most popular protocols in the sector operate.⚙️ Protocols: Gearbox and SentimentNiche: Individual solutionsDesign: Immutable smart contractTraditional DeFi loans from Aave and Compound enable users to leverage positions via recursive borrowing: users supply ETH to borrow USDC, purchase more ETH, and borrow more USDC against their ETH loan. This process leverages the user’s position by continually borrowing against a diminishing amount of collateral.Gearbox and Sentiment give users the ability to leverage positions in a novel fashion.Instead of requiring each loan made to be overcollateralized, these protocols require users to fund an initial margin amount, after which users may borrow with up to 10x leverage (Gearbox) or up to 5x leverage (Sentiment).Minimum collateralization ratios for volatile assets of 150% or greater are common for money market and stablecoin protocols. That’s bad capital-inefficiency. Minimum collateralization ratios for Gearbox and Sentiment are 10% and 20%, respectively. Much better.But how do these protocols ensure borrowers do not simply abscond with these borrowed funds?Both require users to create an escrow wallet with the protocol. These wallets do not allow users to withdraw enough collateral to fall below collateralization requirements.Additionally, wallets are only able to interact with smart contracts specifically approved by the protocols. A hack or exploit of third-party smart contracts used for lending or yield farming activities risks leaving Gearbox or Sentiment with bad debt. To avoid this, the protocols whitelist only the most established dApps for use.⚠️ Risks: Hacks of whitelisted protocols may result in bad debt and loss of lender funds. Lenders must incorporate an assessment of potential smart contract and hack risk from all whitelisted protocols, in addition to either Gearbox or Sentiment, when evaluating their risk exposure.🥞 Protocols: Maple Finance, TrueFi, Clearpool, Goldfinch, Atlendis, and Ribbon LendNiche: Institutional solutionsDesign: Trust-Based LoanThese protocols represent the simplest solution to unsecured lending in DeFi and essentially duplicate trusted TradFi LOC environments on-chain.Potential borrowers are required to navigate a credit approval process to borrow. This process varies based on the dApp.After the completion of the credit approval process, an off-chain legally binding agreement is made between entities representing the borrower and protocol.Maple Finance has professional credit analysts stake its native token, MPL, to underwrite, negotiate, and approve loans.TrueFi expands on Maple’s approach, requiring an 80% approval of proposed loans by TRU stakers.Clearpool, Goldfinch, Atlendis, and Ribbon Lend outsource their credit checks and risk assessment processes to preapproved, third-party auditors.This relatively mature model dominates the unsecured lending sector, comprising over 84% of borrowing volume in this sector (99% if excluding Gearbox!).Institutions such as Alameda Research and Wintermute represented the primary demand source for this category of borrowing. In September, Alameda paid down over $280M in outstanding loans on Maple Finance.5/ They also had a @maplefinance pool that originated almost $300m of loans to them

But no loans are active at the moment pic.twitter.com/W2AbobxWVr— RWA.xyz (@rwa_xyz) November 8, 2022

Orthogonal Capital, a major lender to Alameda via Maple, terminated its relation with the firm shortly after the maturity of its outstanding loans, citing declining asset quality, unclear capital policies, less than robust operational and business practices, and an increasingly byzantine corporate structure.The implosion of Alameda rocked DeFi users’ faith in unsecured lending, with undercollateralized lending protocols seeing massive drawdowns in TVL in the immediate aftermath.seeing massive drops in TVL for uncollateralized lending protocols as confidence in lending to MMs drops after the FTX fiasco

in some protocols, such as maple, user deposits are locked for months, so ppl can't withdraw, which explains the smaller TVL drops pic.twitter.com/1nNPFmWUH8— 0xngmi (aggregatoor arc) (@0xngmi) November 14, 2022

⚠️ Risks: Simply put, trust. At the end of the day, you, as the lender, must have faith that the entity you are lending to will repay the loan. You must perform thorough due diligence before lending any significant amount! Do not blindly trust in the borrower’s ability to repay the obligation! This is the riskiest category of unsecured lending primitive covered in this guide!If the borrower becomes bankrupt, your claim to repayment is lumped in with every other claim to the entity’s assets. Bankruptcy proceedings, especially for highly sophisticated and extremely complex financial entities such as prop trading firms and hedge funds, are notoriously arduous and time consuming, often taking years to settle (Mt. Gox’s trustee recently notified creditors to register for repayment in July).As seen in the below image, Alameda currently has over $12M in outstanding debts on TrueFi. We believe that lenders to this fund will not be made whole and most certainly will not receive a 5.33% yield. While the impairment to value of this pool is unknown at this time, it will likely be significant.💱 Protocol: dAMMNiche: Institutional SolutionsDesign: Diversified Trust-Based LoanLaunched in September, dAMM looks to empower unsecured borrowing and lending markets for volatile assets. Prior to dAMM, institutions (specifically professional market makers) struggled to borrow the majority of crypto assets because:Existing DeFi unsecured lending primitives primarily offer stablecoin-denominated loansInstitutional lenders are wary to stray beyond mainstream assetsDeFi collateralized lending primitives require full collateralization and pose liquidation riskLending markets for small cap tokens are susceptible to flash loan exploitsSimilar to trust-based lending protocols like Maple Finance, dAMM engages a third-party auditor to underwrite potential borrowers. After successful completion of the credit assessment process, the borrower and the dAMM Foundation enter into a legally-binding loan agreement.Where dAMM differs from the trust-based lending model popularized by Maple is how it reduces risk through diversification, by aggregating lending supply and borrowing demand in pools.Any borrower can borrow any asset at the interest rate algorithmically determined by dAMM. This implies that lenders have proportional exposure to all parties borrowing their assets, based on that party’s utilization rate.

Additionally diversification benefits are negligible if a single entity comprises an outsized fraction of borrowing activity for a specific asset pool.💰 Protocol: Debt DAONiche: Institutional solutionsDesign: DeFi bondTradFi companies raise money through two sources: equity and debt financing.

For every $1 borrowed, at least $1 must be deposited as collateral to ensure lenders can be made whole in the event of default.If the value of a user’s collateral falls below the collateralization requirement for their position, the user is automatically liquidated by smart contracts.While these primitives empower a trustless lending and borrowing experience that allows any DeFi user to borrow capital or leverage positions, they suck from a capital efficiency standpoint.Undercollateralized (or unsecured) lending solves this problem.Have you ever taken out a massive student loan or purchased an $8 coffee on a credit card?Congratulations! You are an unsecured debtor! Borrowers of unsecured loans remain current on outstanding debt obligations, despite not pledging any collateral, as their reputation (credit score) is negatively impacted by events such as missed interest payments or loan defaults.The institutional version of a credit card is known as a line of credit (LOC) — a legally binding agreement between two or more counterparties establishing the conditions that must be met for the borrower to draw on the line and remain in compliance.This style of instrument allows the recipient to borrow without pledging any collateral to the lender. LOCs enable financial institutions to meet short-term cash needs without calling capital from investors or losing control of assets.What purpose do undercollateralized lending protocols in crypto serve?They allow TradFi institutions to borrow directly from DeFi users, instead of financial institutions or banks. The borrower and DeFi protocol work together to establish terms for the line. Users can then assess the pool’s risk/reward tradeoff and choose to deposit their own funds to the pool. At the maturity of the loan, the institution pays back any outstanding principal or accrued interest to lenders.Many different approaches exist to enable unsecured crypto lending. Some offer tiered cash flow repayment structures. Others aggregate lender funds, increasing portfolio diversification and reducing the impact of a given borrower’s default. Some allow borrowers to implement KYC/AML checks. All are attempt to satiate TradFi’s demand for undercollateralized loans.2️. Why CeFi Lenders FailedBefore we dive into the state of undercollateralized lending within DeFi, let’s touch on some of the issues with credit in CeFi. Some of these practices pushed many centralized lenders into (near) insolvency.If I could summarize the failure of CeFi lending in one phrase, it would be this: They ran a lending business, rather than a crypto lending business.CeFi lenders simply weren’t in the business of utilizing the underlying technology rails on which they operated (blockchains) within their lending and business processes.Here are a few reasons why CeFi lenders failed.Failure To Evaluate Counterparty RiskMany CeFi lenders had a poor underwriting process. For instance, in the height of the bull run, many lenders would determine a borrower's creditworthiness based on things like questionnaires or even social capital. These are incredibly shaky foundations on which to originate a loan in any industry, let alone in crypto where many institutions are unregulated and do not have audited financials.A prime example of this is the infamous “AUM Letter” from 3AC after the collapse of Terra.The transparency of blockchains would have helped tremendously with assessing counterparty risk. Rather than rely on a letter from Kyle Davies, these firms could have demanded that 3AC provide cryptographically signed messages from wallet addresses to prove they had possession of a requisite amount of funds. These firms could have also implemented covenants to restrict how funds were used, and could monitor these addresses in order to ascertain whether or not 3AC was adhering to the covenants laid out in the agreement.This is an oversimplified example, but in doing this (or something along these lines) lenders would have much more insight into 3AC’s financial position and their use of funds. These lenders could use blockchains to verify that 3AC wasn’t acting in bad faith, rather than trust their word on it.Illiquid Collateral and Poor Liquidation MechanismsAnother critical issue faced by CeFi lenders was the acceptance of poor and illiquid assets as collateral.We don’t need to look any further for evidence of this than the FTX collapse last week. Alameda Research would pledge tokens such as FTT and SRM as collateral for loans. These assets had artificially inflated fully-diluted valuations due to predatory design, as these tokens would have a very low percentage of their float circulating, which allowed Alameda to increase their borrowing capacity.In reality, these high FDVs were a complete mirage, as there was nowhere near enough liquidity in the market to support these valuations during a mass-liquidation event. That is exactly why (along with a general exodus from Sam coins) assets like FTT and SRM sold off so dramatically last week as Alameda’s collateral was liquidated and FTX imploded.But collateral quality only tells half the story. The other half are archaic liquidation processes. In CeFi, liquidations are manual (not smart contract based), meaning that lenders are at risk of taking on underwater debt positions from failing to sell depreciating collateral in a timely manner.These issues could have been somewhat mitigated were lenders to have implemented stricter standards for collateral. For instance, many DeFi protocols also utilized “bad” illiquid assets as collateral. On November 3, just days before FTX and Alameda went under, 35% of the total supply of the decentralized MIM stablecoin by Abracadabra was backed by FTT.I am probably a broken record at this point but if you really think there is a high chance of Alameda insolvency, the best trade is by far short $MIM. It is backed 35% by FTT collateral and I very much doubt it could be liquidated effectively if Alameda can't repa pic.twitter.com/bvtlR0bxWF— Spreek (@spreekaway) November 3, 2022

While MIM briefly de-pegged, the protocol has survived in large part because of its robust liquidation process. Alameda repaid all of its MIM debt, because it knew that should it fail to, their collateral liquidated without prejudice.Centralized lenders should have taken a similar approach. For example, there’s no reason why lenders could not have created a programmatic loan agreement via a smart contract that would originate a loan and liquidate a borrower's collateral should it fall below a certain LTV.A Lack of Transparency For End UsersFinally, along with poor underwriting and liquidation processes, CeFi lending platforms suffer from a grievous lack of transparency.These platforms were black boxes.Users who deposited assets into lenders like BlockFi or Celsius were given scant details about who their funds were being lent out to and where the yield they earned was derived from. When community members discovered how returns were being generated, the results were often not pretty.For instance, savvy-on-chain analysts were able to determine that Celsius deployed customer funds into risky yield farming strategies, losing tens of millions in the process due to falling victim to exploits.Users of these crypto services could not protect themselves from losses as a result of these strategies, as deposits were completely uninsured.Banks suck. It’s in our name, in case you haven’t noticed. But at least banks offer FDIC insurance to depositors. Even DeFi lenders of all ilk such as Aave, Compound, Maple, offer some sort of protection, whether it be via a token backstop or accumulated protocol reserves.3️. The Market of Undercollateralized DeFiGoldfinch, Maple Finance, and Gearbox currently dominate the undercollateralized lending space, composing 89% of the sector’s borrowing volume. The protocols examined in this guide have an aggregate outstanding loan balance of $419M, at the time of analysis.*A prior version of this article used TVL in place of borrowing volume for the above graphic and any analysis derived from itBroadly speaking, undercollateralized lending protocols can be categorized by two defining features: market niche and design.Undercollateralized lending protocols built for individual users enforce repayment via immutable smart contracts utilized to interact with whitelisted protocols. Anyone can borrow from these protocols and interact with pre-authorized dApps.Institutions, however, frequently deploy funds for market making on CEXs and may wish to use protocols that weren’t whitelisted for individual markets. This is so they can optimize the borrowing process to closely align with TradFi standards by making use of trust assumptions, giving rise to a separate category of primitives, in which underwriting serves as the basis for extending credit and is less permissionless.Let’s explore how some of the most popular protocols in the sector operate.⚙️ Protocols: Gearbox and SentimentNiche: Individual solutionsDesign: Immutable smart contractTraditional DeFi loans from Aave and Compound enable users to leverage positions via recursive borrowing: users supply ETH to borrow USDC, purchase more ETH, and borrow more USDC against their ETH loan. This process leverages the user’s position by continually borrowing against a diminishing amount of collateral.Gearbox and Sentiment give users the ability to leverage positions in a novel fashion.Instead of requiring each loan made to be overcollateralized, these protocols require users to fund an initial margin amount, after which users may borrow with up to 10x leverage (Gearbox) or up to 5x leverage (Sentiment).Minimum collateralization ratios for volatile assets of 150% or greater are common for money market and stablecoin protocols. That’s bad capital-inefficiency. Minimum collateralization ratios for Gearbox and Sentiment are 10% and 20%, respectively. Much better.But how do these protocols ensure borrowers do not simply abscond with these borrowed funds?Both require users to create an escrow wallet with the protocol. These wallets do not allow users to withdraw enough collateral to fall below collateralization requirements.Additionally, wallets are only able to interact with smart contracts specifically approved by the protocols. A hack or exploit of third-party smart contracts used for lending or yield farming activities risks leaving Gearbox or Sentiment with bad debt. To avoid this, the protocols whitelist only the most established dApps for use.⚠️ Risks: Hacks of whitelisted protocols may result in bad debt and loss of lender funds. Lenders must incorporate an assessment of potential smart contract and hack risk from all whitelisted protocols, in addition to either Gearbox or Sentiment, when evaluating their risk exposure.🥞 Protocols: Maple Finance, TrueFi, Clearpool, Goldfinch, Atlendis, and Ribbon LendNiche: Institutional solutionsDesign: Trust-Based LoanThese protocols represent the simplest solution to unsecured lending in DeFi and essentially duplicate trusted TradFi LOC environments on-chain.Potential borrowers are required to navigate a credit approval process to borrow. This process varies based on the dApp.After the completion of the credit approval process, an off-chain legally binding agreement is made between entities representing the borrower and protocol.Maple Finance has professional credit analysts stake its native token, MPL, to underwrite, negotiate, and approve loans.TrueFi expands on Maple’s approach, requiring an 80% approval of proposed loans by TRU stakers.Clearpool, Goldfinch, Atlendis, and Ribbon Lend outsource their credit checks and risk assessment processes to preapproved, third-party auditors.This relatively mature model dominates the unsecured lending sector, comprising over 84% of borrowing volume in this sector (99% if excluding Gearbox!).Institutions such as Alameda Research and Wintermute represented the primary demand source for this category of borrowing. In September, Alameda paid down over $280M in outstanding loans on Maple Finance.5/ They also had a @maplefinance pool that originated almost $300m of loans to them

Orthogonal Capital, a major lender to Alameda via Maple, terminated its relation with the firm shortly after the maturity of its outstanding loans, citing declining asset quality, unclear capital policies, less than robust operational and business practices, and an increasingly byzantine corporate structure.The implosion of Alameda rocked DeFi users’ faith in unsecured lending, with undercollateralized lending protocols seeing massive drawdowns in TVL in the immediate aftermath.seeing massive drops in TVL for uncollateralized lending protocols as confidence in lending to MMs drops after the FTX fiasco

⚠️ Risks: Simply put, trust. At the end of the day, you, as the lender, must have faith that the entity you are lending to will repay the loan. You must perform thorough due diligence before lending any significant amount! Do not blindly trust in the borrower’s ability to repay the obligation! This is the riskiest category of unsecured lending primitive covered in this guide!If the borrower becomes bankrupt, your claim to repayment is lumped in with every other claim to the entity’s assets. Bankruptcy proceedings, especially for highly sophisticated and extremely complex financial entities such as prop trading firms and hedge funds, are notoriously arduous and time consuming, often taking years to settle (Mt. Gox’s trustee recently notified creditors to register for repayment in July).As seen in the below image, Alameda currently has over $12M in outstanding debts on TrueFi. We believe that lenders to this fund will not be made whole and most certainly will not receive a 5.33% yield. While the impairment to value of this pool is unknown at this time, it will likely be significant.💱 Protocol: dAMMNiche: Institutional SolutionsDesign: Diversified Trust-Based LoanLaunched in September, dAMM looks to empower unsecured borrowing and lending markets for volatile assets. Prior to dAMM, institutions (specifically professional market makers) struggled to borrow the majority of crypto assets because:Existing DeFi unsecured lending primitives primarily offer stablecoin-denominated loansInstitutional lenders are wary to stray beyond mainstream assetsDeFi collateralized lending primitives require full collateralization and pose liquidation riskLending markets for small cap tokens are susceptible to flash loan exploitsSimilar to trust-based lending protocols like Maple Finance, dAMM engages a third-party auditor to underwrite potential borrowers. After successful completion of the credit assessment process, the borrower and the dAMM Foundation enter into a legally-binding loan agreement.Where dAMM differs from the trust-based lending model popularized by Maple is how it reduces risk through diversification, by aggregating lending supply and borrowing demand in pools.Any borrower can borrow any asset at the interest rate algorithmically determined by dAMM. This implies that lenders have proportional exposure to all parties borrowing their assets, based on that party’s utilization rate. By aggregating supply, lenders receive benefits from diversification: the default or bankruptcy of one borrower only jeopardizes a portion of the pool’s funds.⚠️ Risks: Similar to the trust-based loan category, lenders on dAMM are exposed to borrower default. Increasing the diversification of the borrower set, however, decreases the expected write off rate of the loan, trending towards the aggregate market default rate.Borrower diversification also presents a downside for dAMM lenders.Lending in aggregate eliminates users’ ability to select individual borrowers, forcing users to greater amounts of trust in the credit assessor and their evaluation of borrower risk. Additionally diversification benefits are negligible if a single entity comprises an outsized fraction of borrowing activity for a specific asset pool.💰 Protocol: Debt DAONiche: Institutional solutionsDesign: DeFi bondTradFi companies raise money through two sources: equity and debt financing. Equity-like financing is commonplace for DAOs and protocols, with a seemingly endless number of venture capitalists and individual investors jockey to get in on the next hottest project’s funding round or token sale (Bitcoiners don’t like this!).Debt financing for DAOs, however, is practically non-existent. It’s not hard to see why. If you can’t hold a DAO legally liable, their debt is not much assurance to a potential investor.Porter Finance previously facilitated a $3.1M convertible bond issuance for Ribbon Finance. The notes mature on December 4, 2022, with a minimum yield of 7.1%, and 384% collateralized by Ribbon Finance’s RBN token.On July 4th, less than one month after the launch of the Ribbon offering, Porter Finance announced it was shutting down its platform after the maturity of the issuance, citing a lack of confidence in the potential for “large inflows of lending demand for fixed income DeFi products, like the ones offered through Porter Finance.” The founder also noted the competitive financing rates offered by TradFi firms and a lack of institutional DeFi adoption, in addition potential underlying legal risks, as factors of the decision.The withdrawal of Porter Finance leaves Debt DAO as the major player in the DeFi-native bond issuance space. Debt DAO aims to enable protocols to raise funds for operations without liquidating treasury assets or diluting token holders.To ensure borrowers remain current on obligations, Debt DAO has pioneered the spigot, a unique smart contract which escrows a fixed percentage of protocol revenue for debt service.This contract serves the same role as “lockbox” accounts required by a traditional lender, where operating revenues flow to a designated bank account, from which the lender deducts interest or retains funds prior to receipt by the borrower.As Debt DAO underwrites borrower credit, similar to protocols in the trust-based lending category, and the spigot directly taps into protocol revenue streams, the Project can offer under or uncollateralized loans to riskier decentralized borrowers.⚠️ Risks: Debt DAO’s structure exposes lenders to both repayment and exit risk. While the spigot smart contract can escrow up to 100% of revenue, rapid decreases in the Protocol’s use could jeopardize the cash flow stream and may result in underpayment of interest. Additionally, native tokens collateralizing loans may be illiquid, and in cases where the Protocol’s ability to repay the loan comes into question, it is likely that the collateral’s value will be impaired.4️. An Optimistic Look Into An Undercollateralized FutureIf crypto is to go mainstream, the industry must provide institutional access to credit in order to onboard trillions in capital.  TradFi institutions will not enter into crypto if they need to fully collateralize everything, or will do so with capital generated off-chain.However, if the events of the past several months are any indication, the under-collateralized lending space remains a major work in progress.CeFi lenders across the industry have gone belly-up because of poor risk management. These problems could have been mitigated had they utilized and incorporate the technology rails on which they operate (blockchains) into their business and underwriting processes.The state of undercollateralized lending in DeFi is a step in the right direction but still leaves much to be desired.The protocols which have gotten the most traction, lenders like Maple, TruFi, and Clearpool offer improved transparency relative to their centralized incumbents but still fail to provide lenders with strong repayment guarantees and insight into finances of counterparties whose books reside off-chain.Protocols like Gearbox and Sentiment improve on this model by enforcing loan covenants via smart contracts, as borrowers must maintain a minimum collateral ratio while only being able to utilize funds in whitelisted protocols.DeFi bond protocols which offer more traditional forms of credit like Debt DAO represent a step in the right direction as well, as like Gearbox and Sentiment, they enforce repayment via smart contracts while providing credit to on-chain entities (DAOs) whose financial position can be audited 24/7/365.If you provide credit, there will be defaults. Over the next few cycles, there will be more FTX-sized entities that will become over-leveraged and go under. It’s a part of the game, and lenders are compensated for this risk by being able to charge higher borrow rates.However, by utilizing crypto-rails to increase transparency, minimize counterparty risk, automate repayment and liquidations, and enforce covenants via smart contracts, it will become far easier to identify and mitigate risks before they become systemic.Action steps📖 Read William Peaster’s previous guide on how to lend crypto to institutions📖 Read Donovan’s Monday article: FTX is why we need more DeFi, not less",https://www.bankless.com/ultimate-guide-to-undercollateralized-lending-in-defi,,https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/2022/11/e09d7bcb-503e-4de2-bcbe-53b78223d7ec_2667x1500.webp,Ben Giove,Bankless,blog,Unknown Error,

The Fed can’t default, so they become “secured”. If issued by commercial banks, they rely on rating agencies like Moodys or S&P to determine borrower creditworthiness.DeFi has neither of these tools in their arsenal.Yet, a whole slew of protocols like Maple Finance, Gearbox and TrueFi are already doing it.Even TradFi institutions like FTX & Alameda were huge borrowers in this DeFi market! 🤯How does the world of DeFi govern this risky sector through blockchains and smart contracts?Today’s newsletter is everything you need to know about DeFi undercollateralized lending in one read, brought to you by Bankless analysts Ben and Jack.- Bankless teamWRITER WEDNESDAYSBankless Writers: Ben Giove, Bankless Analyst; Jack Inabinet, Bankless InternThe Ultimate Guide to DeFi Undercollateralized Lending“Undercollateralized” is a dirty phrase in the crypto industry.I'm sure next cycle's big crypto market panic will be because of undercollateralized lending.

From Voyager and Celsius to FTX, this common practice among TradFi institutions has left a wake of insolvency and devastation in its path. Centralized crypto lenders recklessly extended credit to various crypto funds (3AC, Alameda, and others), with the promise of a nice yield that they could pass along to their users, in return.Unfortunately, as these crypto banks have recently learned, the vision for a trade or investment that you lay out in a nice pro forma doesn’t always materialize.We recognize your hesitance to embrace this form of lending, anon, and I hope that this guide may serve in your venture to find the light at the end of a very, very dark unsecured lending tunnel.This article is broken into four main sections:(Un)collateralized Lending 101Why CeFi Lenders FailedThe Market of Undercollateralized DeFiIndividual SolutionsImmutable smart contracts (Gearbox, Sentiment)Institutional SolutionsTrust-based loans (Maple Finance, TrueFi, Clearpool, Goldfinch, Atlendis, and Ribbon Lend)Diversified trust-based loans (dAMM)DeFi bonds (Debt DAO)An Optimistic Look Into A Undercollateralized Future1️.

⚠️ Risks: Simply put, trust. At the end of the day, you, as the lender, must have faith that the entity you are lending to will repay the loan. You must perform thorough due diligence before lending any significant amount! Do not blindly trust in the borrower’s ability to repay the obligation! This is the riskiest category of unsecured lending primitive covered in this guide!If the borrower becomes bankrupt, your claim to repayment is lumped in with every other claim to the entity’s assets. Bankruptcy proceedings, especially for highly sophisticated and extremely complex financial entities such as prop trading firms and hedge funds, are notoriously arduous and time consuming, often taking years to settle (Mt. Gox’s trustee recently notified creditors to register for repayment in July).As seen in the below image, Alameda currently has over $12M in outstanding debts on TrueFi. We believe that lenders to this fund will not be made whole and most certainly will not receive a 5.33% yield. While the impairment to value of this pool is unknown at this time, it will likely be significant.💱 Protocol: dAMMNiche: Institutional SolutionsDesign: Diversified Trust-Based LoanLaunched in September, dAMM looks to empower unsecured borrowing and lending markets for volatile assets.

After successful completion of the credit assessment process, the borrower and the dAMM Foundation enter into a legally-binding loan agreement.Where dAMM differs from the trust-based lending model popularized by Maple is how it reduces risk through diversification, by aggregating lending supply and borrowing demand in pools.Any borrower can borrow any asset at the interest rate algorithmically determined by dAMM. This implies that lenders have proportional exposure to all parties borrowing their assets, based on that party’s utilization rate. By aggregating supply, lenders receive benefits from diversification: the default or bankruptcy of one borrower only jeopardizes a portion of the pool’s funds.⚠️ Risks: Similar to the trust-based loan category, lenders on dAMM are exposed to borrower default. Increasing the diversification of the borrower set, however, decreases the expected write off rate of the loan, trending towards the aggregate market default rate.Borrower diversification also presents a downside for dAMM lenders.Lending in aggregate eliminates users’ ability to select individual borrowers, forcing users to greater amounts of trust in the credit assessor and their evaluation of borrower risk. Additionally diversification benefits are negligible if a single entity comprises an outsized fraction of borrowing activity for a specific asset pool.💰 Protocol: Debt DAONiche: Institutional solutionsDesign: DeFi bondTradFi companies raise money through two sources: equity and debt financing. Equity-like financing is commonplace for DAOs and protocols, with a seemingly endless number of venture capitalists and individual investors jockey to get in on the next hottest project’s funding round or token sale (Bitcoiners don’t like this!).Debt financing for DAOs, however, is practically non-existent. It’s not hard to see why. If you can’t hold a DAO legally liable, their debt is not much assurance to a potential investor.Porter Finance previously facilitated a $3.1M convertible bond issuance for Ribbon Finance. The notes mature on December 4, 2022, with a minimum yield of 7.1%, and 384% collateralized by Ribbon Finance’s RBN token.On July 4th, less than one month after the launch of the Ribbon offering, Porter Finance announced it was shutting down its platform after the maturity of the issuance, citing a lack of confidence in the potential for “large inflows of lending demand for fixed income DeFi products, like the ones offered through Porter Finance.” The founder also noted the competitive financing rates offered by TradFi firms and a lack of institutional DeFi adoption, in addition potential underlying legal risks, as factors of the decision.The withdrawal of Porter Finance leaves Debt DAO as the major player in the DeFi-native bond issuance space. Debt DAO aims to enable protocols to raise funds for operations without liquidating treasury assets or diluting token holders.To ensure borrowers remain current on obligations, Debt DAO has pioneered the spigot, a unique smart contract which escrows a fixed percentage of protocol revenue for debt service.This contract serves the same role as “lockbox” accounts required by a traditional lender, where operating revenues flow to a designated bank account, from which the lender deducts interest or retains funds prior to receipt by the borrower.As Debt DAO underwrites borrower credit, similar to protocols in the trust-based lending category, and the spigot directly taps into protocol revenue streams, the Project can offer under or uncollateralized loans to riskier decentralized borrowers.⚠️ Risks: Debt DAO’s structure exposes lenders to both repayment and exit risk. While the spigot smart contract can escrow up to 100% of revenue, rapid decreases in the Protocol’s use could jeopardize the cash flow stream and may result in underpayment of interest. Additionally, native tokens collateralizing loans may be illiquid, and in cases where the Protocol’s ability to repay the loan comes into question, it is likely that the collateral’s value will be impaired.4️.

The Fed can’t default, so they become “secured”. If issued by commercial banks, they rely on rating agencies like Moodys or S&P to determine borrower creditworthiness.DeFi has neither of these tools in their arsenal.Yet, a whole slew of protocols like Maple Finance, Gearbox and TrueFi are already doing it.Even TradFi institutions like FTX & Alameda were huge borrowers in this DeFi market! 🤯How does the world of DeFi govern this risky sector through blockchains and smart contracts?Today’s newsletter is everything you need to know about DeFi undercollateralized lending in one read, brought to you by Bankless analysts Ben and Jack.- Bankless teamWRITER WEDNESDAYSBankless Writers: Ben Giove, Bankless Analyst; Jack Inabinet, Bankless InternThe Ultimate Guide to DeFi Undercollateralized Lending“Undercollateralized” is a dirty phrase in the crypto industry.I'm sure next cycle's big crypto market panic will be because of undercollateralized lending. It can only really end one way— Ayu Ayu (@SSnuffalupagus) October 14, 2022

From Voyager and Celsius to FTX, this common practice among TradFi institutions has left a wake of insolvency and devastation in its path. Centralized crypto lenders recklessly extended credit to various crypto funds (3AC, Alameda, and others), with the promise of a nice yield that they could pass along to their users, in return.Unfortunately, as these crypto banks have recently learned, the vision for a trade or investment that you lay out in a nice pro forma doesn’t always materialize.We recognize your hesitance to embrace this form of lending, anon, and I hope that this guide may serve in your venture to find the light at the end of a very, very dark unsecured lending tunnel.This article is broken into four main sections:(Un)collateralized Lending 101Why CeFi Lenders FailedThe Market of Undercollateralized DeFiIndividual SolutionsImmutable smart contracts (Gearbox, Sentiment)Institutional SolutionsTrust-based loans (Maple Finance, TrueFi, Clearpool, Goldfinch, Atlendis, and Ribbon Lend)Diversified trust-based loans (dAMM)DeFi bonds (Debt DAO)An Optimistic Look Into A Undercollateralized Future1️. (Un)collateralized Lending 101First, let’s speak about the OG: collateralized lending.Everybody knows collateralized lending, a core DeFi primitive offered by various projects like Aave and Compound.Amidst recent market drawdowns, both have continued to liquidate users failing to manage collateral requirements. Despite a torrent of CeFi and neo-bank implosions, blue-chip DeFi lenders have remained solvent.Both Aave and Compound - as well as stablecoin issuers like MakerDAO - require users to fully collateralize their positions. For every $1 borrowed, at least $1 must be deposited as collateral to ensure lenders can be made whole in the event of default.If the value of a user’s collateral falls below the collateralization requirement for their position, the user is automatically liquidated by smart contracts.While these primitives empower a trustless lending and borrowing experience that allows any DeFi user to borrow capital or leverage positions, they suck from a capital efficiency standpoint.Undercollateralized (or unsecured) lending solves this problem.Have you ever taken out a massive student loan or purchased an $8 coffee on a credit card?Congratulations! You are an unsecured debtor! Borrowers of unsecured loans remain current on outstanding debt obligations, despite not pledging any collateral, as their reputation (credit score) is negatively impacted by events such as missed interest payments or loan defaults.The institutional version of a credit card is known as a line of credit (LOC) — a legally binding agreement between two or more counterparties establishing the conditions that must be met for the borrower to draw on the line and remain in compliance.This style of instrument allows the recipient to borrow without pledging any collateral to the lender. LOCs enable financial institutions to meet short-term cash needs without calling capital from investors or losing control of assets.What purpose do undercollateralized lending protocols in crypto serve?They allow TradFi institutions to borrow directly from DeFi users, instead of financial institutions or banks. The borrower and DeFi protocol work together to establish terms for the line. Users can then assess the pool’s risk/reward tradeoff and choose to deposit their own funds to the pool. At the maturity of the loan, the institution pays back any outstanding principal or accrued interest to lenders.Many different approaches exist to enable unsecured crypto lending. Some offer tiered cash flow repayment structures. Others aggregate lender funds, increasing portfolio diversification and reducing the impact of a given borrower’s default. Some allow borrowers to implement KYC/AML checks. All are attempt to satiate TradFi’s demand for undercollateralized loans.2️. Why CeFi Lenders FailedBefore we dive into the state of undercollateralized lending within DeFi, let’s touch on some of the issues with credit in CeFi. Some of these practices pushed many centralized lenders into (near) insolvency.If I could summarize the failure of CeFi lending in one phrase, it would be this: They ran a lending business, rather than a crypto lending business.CeFi lenders simply weren’t in the business of utilizing the underlying technology rails on which they operated (blockchains) within their lending and business processes.Here are a few reasons why CeFi lenders failed.Failure To Evaluate Counterparty RiskMany CeFi lenders had a poor underwriting process. For instance, in the height of the bull run, many lenders would determine a borrower's creditworthiness based on things like questionnaires or even social capital. These are incredibly shaky foundations on which to originate a loan in any industry, let alone in crypto where many institutions are unregulated and do not have audited financials.A prime example of this is the infamous “AUM Letter” from 3AC after the collapse of Terra.The transparency of blockchains would have helped tremendously with assessing counterparty risk. Rather than rely on a letter from Kyle Davies, these firms could have demanded that 3AC provide cryptographically signed messages from wallet addresses to prove they had possession of a requisite amount of funds. These firms could have also implemented covenants to restrict how funds were used, and could monitor these addresses in order to ascertain whether or not 3AC was adhering to the covenants laid out in the agreement.This is an oversimplified example, but in doing this (or something along these lines) lenders would have much more insight into 3AC’s financial position and their use of funds. These lenders could use blockchains to verify that 3AC wasn’t acting in bad faith, rather than trust their word on it.Illiquid Collateral and Poor Liquidation MechanismsAnother critical issue faced by CeFi lenders was the acceptance of poor and illiquid assets as collateral.We don’t need to look any further for evidence of this than the FTX collapse last week. Alameda Research would pledge tokens such as FTT and SRM as collateral for loans. These assets had artificially inflated fully-diluted valuations due to predatory design, as these tokens would have a very low percentage of their float circulating, which allowed Alameda to increase their borrowing capacity.In reality, these high FDVs were a complete mirage, as there was nowhere near enough liquidity in the market to support these valuations during a mass-liquidation event. That is exactly why (along with a general exodus from Sam coins) assets like FTT and SRM sold off so dramatically last week as Alameda’s collateral was liquidated and FTX imploded.But collateral quality only tells half the story. The other half are archaic liquidation processes. In CeFi, liquidations are manual (not smart contract based), meaning that lenders are at risk of taking on underwater debt positions from failing to sell depreciating collateral in a timely manner.These issues could have been somewhat mitigated were lenders to have implemented stricter standards for collateral. For instance, many DeFi protocols also utilized “bad” illiquid assets as collateral. On November 3, just days before FTX and Alameda went under, 35% of the total supply of the decentralized MIM stablecoin by Abracadabra was backed by FTT.I am probably a broken record at this point but if you really think there is a high chance of Alameda insolvency, the best trade is by far short $MIM. It is backed 35% by FTT collateral and I very much doubt it could be liquidated effectively if Alameda can't repa pic.twitter.com/bvtlR0bxWF— Spreek (@spreekaway) November 3, 2022

While MIM briefly de-pegged, the protocol has survived in large part because of its robust liquidation process. Alameda repaid all of its MIM debt, because it knew that should it fail to, their collateral liquidated without prejudice.Centralized lenders should have taken a similar approach. For example, there’s no reason why lenders could not have created a programmatic loan agreement via a smart contract that would originate a loan and liquidate a borrower's collateral should it fall below a certain LTV.A Lack of Transparency For End UsersFinally, along with poor underwriting and liquidation processes, CeFi lending platforms suffer from a grievous lack of transparency.These platforms were black boxes.Users who deposited assets into lenders like BlockFi or Celsius were given scant details about who their funds were being lent out to and where the yield they earned was derived from. When community members discovered how returns were being generated, the results were often not pretty.For instance, savvy-on-chain analysts were able to determine that Celsius deployed customer funds into risky yield farming strategies, losing tens of millions in the process due to falling victim to exploits.Users of these crypto services could not protect themselves from losses as a result of these strategies, as deposits were completely uninsured.Banks suck. It’s in our name, in case you haven’t noticed. But at least banks offer FDIC insurance to depositors. Even DeFi lenders of all ilk such as Aave, Compound, Maple, offer some sort of protection, whether it be via a token backstop or accumulated protocol reserves.3️. The Market of Undercollateralized DeFiGoldfinch, Maple Finance, and Gearbox currently dominate the undercollateralized lending space, composing 89% of the sector’s borrowing volume. The protocols examined in this guide have an aggregate outstanding loan balance of $419M, at the time of analysis.*A prior version of this article used TVL in place of borrowing volume for the above graphic and any analysis derived from itBroadly speaking, undercollateralized lending protocols can be categorized by two defining features: market niche and design.Undercollateralized lending protocols built for individual users enforce repayment via immutable smart contracts utilized to interact with whitelisted protocols. Anyone can borrow from these protocols and interact with pre-authorized dApps.Institutions, however, frequently deploy funds for market making on CEXs and may wish to use protocols that weren’t whitelisted for individual markets. This is so they can optimize the borrowing process to closely align with TradFi standards by making use of trust assumptions, giving rise to a separate category of primitives, in which underwriting serves as the basis for extending credit and is less permissionless.Let’s explore how some of the most popular protocols in the sector operate.⚙️ Protocols: Gearbox and SentimentNiche: Individual solutionsDesign: Immutable smart contractTraditional DeFi loans from Aave and Compound enable users to leverage positions via recursive borrowing: users supply ETH to borrow USDC, purchase more ETH, and borrow more USDC against their ETH loan. This process leverages the user’s position by continually borrowing against a diminishing amount of collateral.Gearbox and Sentiment give users the ability to leverage positions in a novel fashion.Instead of requiring each loan made to be overcollateralized, these protocols require users to fund an initial margin amount, after which users may borrow with up to 10x leverage (Gearbox) or up to 5x leverage (Sentiment).Minimum collateralization ratios for volatile assets of 150% or greater are common for money market and stablecoin protocols. That’s bad capital-inefficiency. Minimum collateralization ratios for Gearbox and Sentiment are 10% and 20%, respectively. Much better.But how do these protocols ensure borrowers do not simply abscond with these borrowed funds?Both require users to create an escrow wallet with the protocol. These wallets do not allow users to withdraw enough collateral to fall below collateralization requirements.Additionally, wallets are only able to interact with smart contracts specifically approved by the protocols. A hack or exploit of third-party smart contracts used for lending or yield farming activities risks leaving Gearbox or Sentiment with bad debt. To avoid this, the protocols whitelist only the most established dApps for use.⚠️ Risks: Hacks of whitelisted protocols may result in bad debt and loss of lender funds. Lenders must incorporate an assessment of potential smart contract and hack risk from all whitelisted protocols, in addition to either Gearbox or Sentiment, when evaluating their risk exposure.🥞 Protocols: Maple Finance, TrueFi, Clearpool, Goldfinch, Atlendis, and Ribbon LendNiche: Institutional solutionsDesign: Trust-Based LoanThese protocols represent the simplest solution to unsecured lending in DeFi and essentially duplicate trusted TradFi LOC environments on-chain.Potential borrowers are required to navigate a credit approval process to borrow.

Porter Finance previously facilitated a $3.1M convertible bond issuance for Ribbon Finance. The notes mature on December 4, 2022, with a minimum yield of 7.1%, and 384% collateralized by Ribbon Finance’s RBN token. On July 4th, less than one month after the launch of the Ribbon offering, Porter Finance announced it was shutting down its platform after the maturity of the issuance, citing a lack of confidence in the potential for “large inflows of lending demand for fixed income DeFi products, like the ones offered through Porter Finance.” The founder also noted the competitive financing rates offered by TradFi firms and a lack of institutional DeFi adoption, in addition potential underlying legal risks, as factors of the decision. The withdrawal of Porter Finance leaves Debt DAO as the major player in the DeFi-native bond issuance space. Debt DAO aims to enable protocols to raise funds for operations without liquidating treasury assets or diluting token holders. To ensure borrowers remain current on obligations, Debt DAO has pioneered the spigot, a unique smart contract which escrows a fixed percentage of protocol revenue for debt service. This contract serves the same role as “lockbox” accounts required by a traditional lender, where operating revenues flow to a designated bank account, from which the lender deducts interest or retains funds prior to receipt by the borrower. As Debt DAO underwrites borrower credit, similar to protocols in the trust-based lending category, and the spigot directly taps into protocol revenue streams, the Project can offer under or uncollateralized loans to riskier decentralized borrowers. ⚠️ Risks : Debt DAO’s structure exposes lenders to both repayment and exit risk. While the spigot smart contract can escrow up to 100% of revenue, rapid decreases in the Protocol’s use could jeopardize the cash flow stream and may result in underpayment of interest. Additionally, native tokens collateralizing loans may be illiquid, and in cases where the Protocol’s ability to repay the loan comes into question, it is likely that the collateral’s value will be impaired.","Dear Bankless Nation,Undercollateralized lending is risky business.In TradFi, these loans typically come from the federal funds market.

From Voyager and Celsius to FTX, this common practice among TradFi institutions has left a wake of insolvency and devastation in its path. Centralized crypto lenders recklessly extended credit to various crypto funds (3AC, Alameda, and others), with the promise of a nice yield that they could pass along to their users, in return.Unfortunately, as these crypto banks have recently learned, the vision for a trade or investment that you lay out in a nice pro forma doesn’t always materialize.We recognize your hesitance to embrace this form of lending, anon, and I hope that this guide may serve in your venture to find the light at the end of a very, very dark unsecured lending tunnel.This article is broken into four main sections:(Un)collateralized Lending 101Why CeFi Lenders FailedThe Market of Undercollateralized DeFiIndividual SolutionsImmutable smart contracts (Gearbox, Sentiment)Institutional SolutionsTrust-based loans (Maple Finance, TrueFi, Clearpool, Goldfinch, Atlendis, and Ribbon Lend)Diversified trust-based loans (dAMM)DeFi bonds (Debt DAO)An Optimistic Look Into A Undercollateralized Future1️. (Un)collateralized Lending 101First, let’s speak about the OG: collateralized lending.Everybody knows collateralized lending, a core DeFi primitive offered by various projects like Aave and Compound.Amidst recent market drawdowns, both have continued to liquidate users failing to manage collateral requirements. Despite a torrent of CeFi and neo-bank implosions, blue-chip DeFi lenders have remained solvent.Both Aave and Compound - as well as stablecoin issuers like MakerDAO - require users to fully collateralize their positions. For every $1 borrowed, at least $1 must be deposited as collateral to ensure lenders can be made whole in the event of default.If the value of a user’s collateral falls below the collateralization requirement for their position, the user is automatically liquidated by smart contracts.While these primitives empower a trustless lending and borrowing experience that allows any DeFi user to borrow capital or leverage positions, they suck from a capital efficiency standpoint.Undercollateralized (or unsecured) lending solves this problem.Have you ever taken out a massive student loan or purchased an $8 coffee on a credit card?Congratulations! You are an unsecured debtor! Borrowers of unsecured loans remain current on outstanding debt obligations, despite not pledging any collateral, as their reputation (credit score) is negatively impacted by events such as missed interest payments or loan defaults.The institutional version of a credit card is known as a line of credit (LOC) — a legally binding agreement between two or more counterparties establishing the conditions that must be met for the borrower to draw on the line and remain in compliance.This style of instrument allows the recipient to borrow without pledging any collateral to the lender. LOCs enable financial institutions to meet short-term cash needs without calling capital from investors or losing control of assets.What purpose do undercollateralized lending protocols in crypto serve?They allow TradFi institutions to borrow directly from DeFi users, instead of financial institutions or banks. The borrower and DeFi protocol work together to establish terms for the line. Users can then assess the pool’s risk/reward tradeoff and choose to deposit their own funds to the pool. At the maturity of the loan, the institution pays back any outstanding principal or accrued interest to lenders.Many different approaches exist to enable unsecured crypto lending. Some offer tiered cash flow repayment structures. Others aggregate lender funds, increasing portfolio diversification and reducing the impact of a given borrower’s default. Some allow borrowers to implement KYC/AML checks. All are attempt to satiate TradFi’s demand for undercollateralized loans.2️. Why CeFi Lenders FailedBefore we dive into the state of undercollateralized lending within DeFi, let’s touch on some of the issues with credit in CeFi. Some of these practices pushed many centralized lenders into (near) insolvency.If I could summarize the failure of CeFi lending in one phrase, it would be this: They ran a lending business, rather than a crypto lending business.CeFi lenders simply weren’t in the business of utilizing the underlying technology rails on which they operated (blockchains) within their lending and business processes.Here are a few reasons why CeFi lenders failed.Failure To Evaluate Counterparty RiskMany CeFi lenders had a poor underwriting process. For instance, in the height of the bull run, many lenders would determine a borrower's creditworthiness based on things like questionnaires or even social capital. These are incredibly shaky foundations on which to originate a loan in any industry, let alone in crypto where many institutions are unregulated and do not have audited financials.A prime example of this is the infamous “AUM Letter” from 3AC after the collapse of Terra.The transparency of blockchains would have helped tremendously with assessing counterparty risk. Rather than rely on a letter from Kyle Davies, these firms could have demanded that 3AC provide cryptographically signed messages from wallet addresses to prove they had possession of a requisite amount of funds. These firms could have also implemented covenants to restrict how funds were used, and could monitor these addresses in order to ascertain whether or not 3AC was adhering to the covenants laid out in the agreement.This is an oversimplified example, but in doing this (or something along these lines) lenders would have much more insight into 3AC’s financial position and their use of funds. These lenders could use blockchains to verify that 3AC wasn’t acting in bad faith, rather than trust their word on it.Illiquid Collateral and Poor Liquidation MechanismsAnother critical issue faced by CeFi lenders was the acceptance of poor and illiquid assets as collateral.We don’t need to look any further for evidence of this than the FTX collapse last week. Alameda Research would pledge tokens such as FTT and SRM as collateral for loans. These assets had artificially inflated fully-diluted valuations due to predatory design, as these tokens would have a very low percentage of their float circulating, which allowed Alameda to increase their borrowing capacity.In reality, these high FDVs were a complete mirage, as there was nowhere near enough liquidity in the market to support these valuations during a mass-liquidation event. That is exactly why (along with a general exodus from Sam coins) assets like FTT and SRM sold off so dramatically last week as Alameda’s collateral was liquidated and FTX imploded.But collateral quality only tells half the story. The other half are archaic liquidation processes. In CeFi, liquidations are manual (not smart contract based), meaning that lenders are at risk of taking on underwater debt positions from failing to sell depreciating collateral in a timely manner.These issues could have been somewhat mitigated were lenders to have implemented stricter standards for collateral. For instance, many DeFi protocols also utilized “bad” illiquid assets as collateral. On November 3, just days before FTX and Alameda went under, 35% of the total supply of the decentralized MIM stablecoin by Abracadabra was backed by FTT.I am probably a broken record at this point but if you really think there is a high chance of Alameda insolvency, the best trade is by far short $MIM. It is backed 35% by FTT collateral and I very much doubt it could be liquidated effectively if Alameda can't repa pic.twitter.com/bvtlR0bxWF— Spreek (@spreekaway) November 3, 2022

While MIM briefly de-pegged, the protocol has survived in large part because of its robust liquidation process. Alameda repaid all of its MIM debt, because it knew that should it fail to, their collateral liquidated without prejudice.Centralized lenders should have taken a similar approach. For example, there’s no reason why lenders could not have created a programmatic loan agreement via a smart contract that would originate a loan and liquidate a borrower's collateral should it fall below a certain LTV.A Lack of Transparency For End UsersFinally, along with poor underwriting and liquidation processes, CeFi lending platforms suffer from a grievous lack of transparency.These platforms were black boxes.Users who deposited assets into lenders like BlockFi or Celsius were given scant details about who their funds were being lent out to and where the yield they earned was derived from. When community members discovered how returns were being generated, the results were often not pretty.For instance, savvy-on-chain analysts were able to determine that Celsius deployed customer funds into risky yield farming strategies, losing tens of millions in the process due to falling victim to exploits.Users of these crypto services could not protect themselves from losses as a result of these strategies, as deposits were completely uninsured.Banks suck. It’s in our name, in case you haven’t noticed. But at least banks offer FDIC insurance to depositors. Even DeFi lenders of all ilk such as Aave, Compound, Maple, offer some sort of protection, whether it be via a token backstop or accumulated protocol reserves.3️. The Market of Undercollateralized DeFiGoldfinch, Maple Finance, and Gearbox currently dominate the undercollateralized lending space, composing 89% of the sector’s borrowing volume. The protocols examined in this guide have an aggregate outstanding loan balance of $419M, at the time of analysis.*A prior version of this article used TVL in place of borrowing volume for the above graphic and any analysis derived from itBroadly speaking, undercollateralized lending protocols can be categorized by two defining features: market niche and design.Undercollateralized lending protocols built for individual users enforce repayment via immutable smart contracts utilized to interact with whitelisted protocols. Anyone can borrow from these protocols and interact with pre-authorized dApps.Institutions, however, frequently deploy funds for market making on CEXs and may wish to use protocols that weren’t whitelisted for individual markets. This is so they can optimize the borrowing process to closely align with TradFi standards by making use of trust assumptions, giving rise to a separate category of primitives, in which underwriting serves as the basis for extending credit and is less permissionless.Let’s explore how some of the most popular protocols in the sector operate.⚙️ Protocols: Gearbox and SentimentNiche: Individual solutionsDesign: Immutable smart contractTraditional DeFi loans from Aave and Compound enable users to leverage positions via recursive borrowing: users supply ETH to borrow USDC, purchase more ETH, and borrow more USDC against their ETH loan. This process leverages the user’s position by continually borrowing against a diminishing amount of collateral.Gearbox and Sentiment give users the ability to leverage positions in a novel fashion.Instead of requiring each loan made to be overcollateralized, these protocols require users to fund an initial margin amount, after which users may borrow with up to 10x leverage (Gearbox) or up to 5x leverage (Sentiment).Minimum collateralization ratios for volatile assets of 150% or greater are common for money market and stablecoin protocols. That’s bad capital-inefficiency. Minimum collateralization ratios for Gearbox and Sentiment are 10% and 20%, respectively. Much better.But how do these protocols ensure borrowers do not simply abscond with these borrowed funds?Both require users to create an escrow wallet with the protocol. These wallets do not allow users to withdraw enough collateral to fall below collateralization requirements.Additionally, wallets are only able to interact with smart contracts specifically approved by the protocols. A hack or exploit of third-party smart contracts used for lending or yield farming activities risks leaving Gearbox or Sentiment with bad debt. To avoid this, the protocols whitelist only the most established dApps for use.⚠️ Risks: Hacks of whitelisted protocols may result in bad debt and loss of lender funds. Lenders must incorporate an assessment of potential smart contract and hack risk from all whitelisted protocols, in addition to either Gearbox or Sentiment, when evaluating their risk exposure.🥞 Protocols: Maple Finance, TrueFi, Clearpool, Goldfinch, Atlendis, and Ribbon LendNiche: Institutional solutionsDesign: Trust-Based LoanThese protocols represent the simplest solution to unsecured lending in DeFi and essentially duplicate trusted TradFi LOC environments on-chain.Potential borrowers are required to navigate a credit approval process to borrow. This process varies based on the dApp.After the completion of the credit approval process, an off-chain legally binding agreement is made between entities representing the borrower and protocol.Maple Finance has professional credit analysts stake its native token, MPL, to underwrite, negotiate, and approve loans.TrueFi expands on Maple’s approach, requiring an 80% approval of proposed loans by TRU stakers.Clearpool, Goldfinch, Atlendis, and Ribbon Lend outsource their credit checks and risk assessment processes to preapproved, third-party auditors.This relatively mature model dominates the unsecured lending sector, comprising over 84% of borrowing volume in this sector (99% if excluding Gearbox!).Institutions such as Alameda Research and Wintermute represented the primary demand source for this category of borrowing. In September, Alameda paid down over $280M in outstanding loans on Maple Finance.5/ They also had a @maplefinance pool that originated almost $300m of loans to them

But no loans are active at the moment pic.twitter.com/W2AbobxWVr— RWA.xyz (@rwa_xyz) November 8, 2022

Orthogonal Capital, a major lender to Alameda via Maple, terminated its relation with the firm shortly after the maturity of its outstanding loans, citing declining asset quality, unclear capital policies, less than robust operational and business practices, and an increasingly byzantine corporate structure.The implosion of Alameda rocked DeFi users’ faith in unsecured lending, with undercollateralized lending protocols seeing massive drawdowns in TVL in the immediate aftermath.seeing massive drops in TVL for uncollateralized lending protocols as confidence in lending to MMs drops after the FTX fiasco

in some protocols, such as maple, user deposits are locked for months, so ppl can't withdraw, which explains the smaller TVL drops pic.twitter.com/1nNPFmWUH8— 0xngmi (aggregatoor arc) (@0xngmi) November 14, 2022

⚠️ Risks: Simply put, trust. At the end of the day, you, as the lender, must have faith that the entity you are lending to will repay the loan. You must perform thorough due diligence before lending any significant amount! Do not blindly trust in the borrower’s ability to repay the obligation! This is the riskiest category of unsecured lending primitive covered in this guide!If the borrower becomes bankrupt, your claim to repayment is lumped in with every other claim to the entity’s assets. Bankruptcy proceedings, especially for highly sophisticated and extremely complex financial entities such as prop trading firms and hedge funds, are notoriously arduous and time consuming, often taking years to settle (Mt. Gox’s trustee recently notified creditors to register for repayment in July).As seen in the below image, Alameda currently has over $12M in outstanding debts on TrueFi. We believe that lenders to this fund will not be made whole and most certainly will not receive a 5.33% yield. While the impairment to value of this pool is unknown at this time, it will likely be significant.💱 Protocol: dAMMNiche: Institutional SolutionsDesign: Diversified Trust-Based LoanLaunched in September, dAMM looks to empower unsecured borrowing and lending markets for volatile assets. Prior to dAMM, institutions (specifically professional market makers) struggled to borrow the majority of crypto assets because:Existing DeFi unsecured lending primitives primarily offer stablecoin-denominated loansInstitutional lenders are wary to stray beyond mainstream assetsDeFi collateralized lending primitives require full collateralization and pose liquidation riskLending markets for small cap tokens are susceptible to flash loan exploitsSimilar to trust-based lending protocols like Maple Finance, dAMM engages a third-party auditor to underwrite potential borrowers. After successful completion of the credit assessment process, the borrower and the dAMM Foundation enter into a legally-binding loan agreement.Where dAMM differs from the trust-based lending model popularized by Maple is how it reduces risk through diversification, by aggregating lending supply and borrowing demand in pools.Any borrower can borrow any asset at the interest rate algorithmically determined by dAMM. This implies that lenders have proportional exposure to all parties borrowing their assets, based on that party’s utilization rate. By aggregating supply, lenders receive benefits from diversification: the default or bankruptcy of one borrower only jeopardizes a portion of the pool’s funds.⚠️ Risks: Similar to the trust-based loan category, lenders on dAMM are exposed to borrower default. Increasing the diversification of the borrower set, however, decreases the expected write off rate of the loan, trending towards the aggregate market default rate.Borrower diversification also presents a downside for dAMM lenders.Lending in aggregate eliminates users’ ability to select individual borrowers, forcing users to greater amounts of trust in the credit assessor and their evaluation of borrower risk. Additionally diversification benefits are negligible if a single entity comprises an outsized fraction of borrowing activity for a specific asset pool.💰 Protocol: Debt DAONiche: Institutional solutionsDesign: DeFi bondTradFi companies raise money through two sources: equity and debt financing. Equity-like financing is commonplace for DAOs and protocols, with a seemingly endless number of venture capitalists and individual investors jockey to get in on the next hottest project’s funding round or token sale (Bitcoiners don’t like this!).Debt financing for DAOs, however, is practically non-existent.

An Optimistic Look Into An Undercollateralized FutureIf crypto is to go mainstream, the industry must provide institutional access to credit in order to onboard trillions in capital.  TradFi institutions will not enter into crypto if they need to fully collateralize everything, or will do so with capital generated off-chain.However, if the events of the past several months are any indication, the under-collateralized lending space remains a major work in progress.CeFi lenders across the industry have gone belly-up because of poor risk management. These problems could have been mitigated had they utilized and incorporate the technology rails on which they operate (blockchains) into their business and underwriting processes.The state of undercollateralized lending in DeFi is a step in the right direction but still leaves much to be desired.The protocols which have gotten the most traction, lenders like Maple, TruFi, and Clearpool offer improved transparency relative to their centralized incumbents but still fail to provide lenders with strong repayment guarantees and insight into finances of counterparties whose books reside off-chain.Protocols like Gearbox and Sentiment improve on this model by enforcing loan covenants via smart contracts, as borrowers must maintain a minimum collateral ratio while only being able to utilize funds in whitelisted protocols.DeFi bond protocols which offer more traditional forms of credit like Debt DAO represent a step in the right direction as well, as like Gearbox and Sentiment, they enforce repayment via smart contracts while providing credit to on-chain entities (DAOs) whose financial position can be audited 24/7/365.If you provide credit, there will be defaults. Over the next few cycles, there will be more FTX-sized entities that will become over-leveraged and go under. It’s a part of the game, and lenders are compensated for this risk by being able to charge higher borrow rates.However, by utilizing crypto-rails to increase transparency, minimize counterparty risk, automate repayment and liquidations, and enforce covenants via smart contracts, it will become far easier to identify and mitigate risks before they become systemic.Action steps📖 Read William Peaster’s previous guide on how to lend crypto to institutions📖 Read Donovan’s Monday article: FTX is why we need more DeFi, not less",https://www.bankless.com/ultimate-guide-to-undercollateralized-lending-in-defi,,https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/2022/11/e09d7bcb-503e-4de2-bcbe-53b78223d7ec_2667x1500.webp,Ben Giove,Bankless,blog,Unknown Error,

For example, there’s no reason why lenders could not have created a programmatic loan agreement via a smart contract that would originate a loan and liquidate a borrower's collateral should it fall below a certain LTV.A Lack of Transparency For End UsersFinally, along with poor underwriting and liquidation processes, CeFi lending platforms suffer from a grievous lack of transparency.These platforms were black boxes.Users who deposited assets into lenders like BlockFi or Celsius were given scant details about who their funds were being lent out to and where the yield they earned was derived from. When community members discovered how returns were being generated, the results were often not pretty.For instance, savvy-on-chain analysts were able to determine that Celsius deployed customer funds into risky yield farming strategies, losing tens of millions in the process due to falling victim to exploits.Users of these crypto services could not protect themselves from losses as a result of these strategies, as deposits were completely uninsured.Banks suck. It’s in our name, in case you haven’t noticed. But at least banks offer FDIC insurance to depositors. Even DeFi lenders of all ilk such as Aave, Compound, Maple, offer some sort of protection, whether it be via a token backstop or accumulated protocol reserves.3️. The Market of Undercollateralized DeFiGoldfinch, Maple Finance, and Gearbox currently dominate the undercollateralized lending space, composing 89% of the sector’s borrowing volume. The protocols examined in this guide have an aggregate outstanding loan balance of $419M, at the time of analysis.*A prior version of this article used TVL in place of borrowing volume for the above graphic and any analysis derived from itBroadly speaking, undercollateralized lending protocols can be categorized by two defining features: market niche and design.Undercollateralized lending protocols built for individual users enforce repayment via immutable smart contracts utilized to interact with whitelisted protocols. Anyone can borrow from these protocols and interact with pre-authorized dApps.Institutions, however, frequently deploy funds for market making on CEXs and may wish to use protocols that weren’t whitelisted for individual markets. This is so they can optimize the borrowing process to closely align with TradFi standards by making use of trust assumptions, giving rise to a separate category of primitives, in which underwriting serves as the basis for extending credit and is less permissionless.Let’s explore how some of the most popular protocols in the sector operate.⚙️ Protocols: Gearbox and SentimentNiche: Individual solutionsDesign: Immutable smart contractTraditional DeFi loans from Aave and Compound enable users to leverage positions via recursive borrowing: users supply ETH to borrow USDC, purchase more ETH, and borrow more USDC against their ETH loan. This process leverages the user’s position by continually borrowing against a diminishing amount of collateral.Gearbox and Sentiment give users the ability to leverage positions in a novel fashion.Instead of requiring each loan made to be overcollateralized, these protocols require users to fund an initial margin amount, after which users may borrow with up to 10x leverage (Gearbox) or up to 5x leverage (Sentiment).Minimum collateralization ratios for volatile assets of 150% or greater are common for money market and stablecoin protocols. That’s bad capital-inefficiency. Minimum collateralization ratios for Gearbox and Sentiment are 10% and 20%, respectively. Much better.But how do these protocols ensure borrowers do not simply abscond with these borrowed funds?Both require users to create an escrow wallet with the protocol. These wallets do not allow users to withdraw enough collateral to fall below collateralization requirements.Additionally, wallets are only able to interact with smart contracts specifically approved by the protocols. A hack or exploit of third-party smart contracts used for lending or yield farming activities risks leaving Gearbox or Sentiment with bad debt. To avoid this, the protocols whitelist only the most established dApps for use.⚠️ Risks: Hacks of whitelisted protocols may result in bad debt and loss of lender funds. Lenders must incorporate an assessment of potential smart contract and hack risk from all whitelisted protocols, in addition to either Gearbox or Sentiment, when evaluating their risk exposure.🥞 Protocols: Maple Finance, TrueFi, Clearpool, Goldfinch, Atlendis, and Ribbon LendNiche: Institutional solutionsDesign: Trust-Based LoanThese protocols represent the simplest solution to unsecured lending in DeFi and essentially duplicate trusted TradFi LOC environments on-chain.Potential borrowers are required to navigate a credit approval process to borrow. This process varies based on the dApp.After the completion of the credit approval process, an off-chain legally binding agreement is made between entities representing the borrower and protocol.Maple Finance has professional credit analysts stake its native token, MPL, to underwrite, negotiate, and approve loans.TrueFi expands on Maple’s approach, requiring an 80% approval of proposed loans by TRU stakers.Clearpool, Goldfinch, Atlendis, and Ribbon Lend outsource their credit checks and risk assessment processes to preapproved, third-party auditors.This relatively mature model dominates the unsecured lending sector, comprising over 84% of borrowing volume in this sector (99% if excluding Gearbox!).Institutions such as Alameda Research and Wintermute represented the primary demand source for this category of borrowing. In September, Alameda paid down over $280M in outstanding loans on Maple Finance.5/ They also had a @maplefinance pool that originated almost $300m of loans to them

But no loans are active at the moment pic.twitter.com/W2AbobxWVr— RWA.xyz (@rwa_xyz) November 8, 2022

Orthogonal Capital, a major lender to Alameda via Maple, terminated its relation with the firm shortly after the maturity of its outstanding loans, citing declining asset quality, unclear capital policies, less than robust operational and business practices, and an increasingly byzantine corporate structure.The implosion of Alameda rocked DeFi users’ faith in unsecured lending, with undercollateralized lending protocols seeing massive drawdowns in TVL in the immediate aftermath.seeing massive drops in TVL for uncollateralized lending protocols as confidence in lending to MMs drops after the FTX fiasco

in some protocols, such as maple, user deposits are locked for months, so ppl can't withdraw, which explains the smaller TVL drops pic.twitter.com/1nNPFmWUH8— 0xngmi (aggregatoor arc) (@0xngmi) November 14, 2022

⚠️ Risks: Simply put, trust. At the end of the day, you, as the lender, must have faith that the entity you are lending to will repay the loan. You must perform thorough due diligence before lending any significant amount! Do not blindly trust in the borrower’s ability to repay the obligation! This is the riskiest category of unsecured lending primitive covered in this guide!If the borrower becomes bankrupt, your claim to repayment is lumped in with every other claim to the entity’s assets. Bankruptcy proceedings, especially for highly sophisticated and extremely complex financial entities such as prop trading firms and hedge funds, are notoriously arduous and time consuming, often taking years to settle (Mt. Gox’s trustee recently notified creditors to register for repayment in July).As seen in the below image, Alameda currently has over $12M in outstanding debts on TrueFi. We believe that lenders to this fund will not be made whole and most certainly will not receive a 5.33% yield. While the impairment to value of this pool is unknown at this time, it will likely be significant.💱 Protocol: dAMMNiche: Institutional SolutionsDesign: Diversified Trust-Based LoanLaunched in September, dAMM looks to empower unsecured borrowing and lending markets for volatile assets. Prior to dAMM, institutions (specifically professional market makers) struggled to borrow the majority of crypto assets because:Existing DeFi unsecured lending primitives primarily offer stablecoin-denominated loansInstitutional lenders are wary to stray beyond mainstream assetsDeFi collateralized lending primitives require full collateralization and pose liquidation riskLending markets for small cap tokens are susceptible to flash loan exploitsSimilar to trust-based lending protocols like Maple Finance, dAMM engages a third-party auditor to underwrite potential borrowers. After successful completion of the credit assessment process, the borrower and the dAMM Foundation enter into a legally-binding loan agreement.Where dAMM differs from the trust-based lending model popularized by Maple is how it reduces risk through diversification, by aggregating lending supply and borrowing demand in pools.Any borrower can borrow any asset at the interest rate algorithmically determined by dAMM. This implies that lenders have proportional exposure to all parties borrowing their assets, based on that party’s utilization rate. By aggregating supply, lenders receive benefits from diversification: the default or bankruptcy of one borrower only jeopardizes a portion of the pool’s funds.⚠️ Risks: Similar to the trust-based loan category, lenders on dAMM are exposed to borrower default. Increasing the diversification of the borrower set, however, decreases the expected write off rate of the loan, trending towards the aggregate market default rate.Borrower diversification also presents a downside for dAMM lenders.Lending in aggregate eliminates users’ ability to select individual borrowers, forcing users to greater amounts of trust in the credit assessor and their evaluation of borrower risk. Additionally diversification benefits are negligible if a single entity comprises an outsized fraction of borrowing activity for a specific asset pool.💰 Protocol: Debt DAONiche: Institutional solutionsDesign: DeFi bondTradFi companies raise money through two sources: equity and debt financing. Equity-like financing is commonplace for DAOs and protocols, with a seemingly endless number of venture capitalists and individual investors jockey to get in on the next hottest project’s funding round or token sale (Bitcoiners don’t like this!).Debt financing for DAOs, however, is practically non-existent. It’s not hard to see why. If you can’t hold a DAO legally liable, their debt is not much assurance to a potential investor.Porter Finance previously facilitated a $3.1M convertible bond issuance for Ribbon Finance. The notes mature on December 4, 2022, with a minimum yield of 7.1%, and 384% collateralized by Ribbon Finance’s RBN token.On July 4th, less than one month after the launch of the Ribbon offering, Porter Finance announced it was shutting down its platform after the maturity of the issuance, citing a lack of confidence in the potential for “large inflows of lending demand for fixed income DeFi products, like the ones offered through Porter Finance.” The founder also noted the competitive financing rates offered by TradFi firms and a lack of institutional DeFi adoption, in addition potential underlying legal risks, as factors of the decision.The withdrawal of Porter Finance leaves Debt DAO as the major player in the DeFi-native bond issuance space. Debt DAO aims to enable protocols to raise funds for operations without liquidating treasury assets or diluting token holders.To ensure borrowers remain current on obligations, Debt DAO has pioneered the spigot, a unique smart contract which escrows a fixed percentage of protocol revenue for debt service.This contract serves the same role as “lockbox” accounts required by a traditional lender, where operating revenues flow to a designated bank account, from which the lender deducts interest or retains funds prior to receipt by the borrower.As Debt DAO underwrites borrower credit, similar to protocols in the trust-based lending category, and the spigot directly taps into protocol revenue streams, the Project can offer under or uncollateralized loans to riskier decentralized borrowers.⚠️ Risks: Debt DAO’s structure exposes lenders to both repayment and exit risk. While the spigot smart contract can escrow up to 100% of revenue, rapid decreases in the Protocol’s use could jeopardize the cash flow stream and may result in underpayment of interest. Additionally, native tokens collateralizing loans may be illiquid, and in cases where the Protocol’s ability to repay the loan comes into question, it is likely that the collateral’s value will be impaired.4️. An Optimistic Look Into An Undercollateralized FutureIf crypto is to go mainstream, the industry must provide institutional access to credit in order to onboard trillions in capital.  TradFi institutions will not enter into crypto if they need to fully collateralize everything, or will do so with capital generated off-chain.However, if the events of the past several months are any indication, the under-collateralized lending space remains a major work in progress.CeFi lenders across the industry have gone belly-up because of poor risk management. These problems could have been mitigated had they utilized and incorporate the technology rails on which they operate (blockchains) into their business and underwriting processes.The state of undercollateralized lending in DeFi is a step in the right direction but still leaves much to be desired.The protocols which have gotten the most traction, lenders like Maple, TruFi, and Clearpool offer improved transparency relative to their centralized incumbents but still fail to provide lenders with strong repayment guarantees and insight into finances of counterparties whose books reside off-chain.Protocols like Gearbox and Sentiment improve on this model by enforcing loan covenants via smart contracts, as borrowers must maintain a minimum collateral ratio while only being able to utilize funds in whitelisted protocols.DeFi bond protocols which offer more traditional forms of credit like Debt DAO represent a step in the right direction as well, as like Gearbox and Sentiment, they enforce repayment via smart contracts while providing credit to on-chain entities (DAOs) whose financial position can be audited 24/7/365.If you provide credit, there will be defaults. Over the next few cycles, there will be more FTX-sized entities that will become over-leveraged and go under. It’s a part of the game, and lenders are compensated for this risk by being able to charge higher borrow rates.However, by utilizing crypto-rails to increase transparency, minimize counterparty risk, automate repayment and liquidations, and enforce covenants via smart contracts, it will become far easier to identify and mitigate risks before they become systemic.Action steps📖 Read William Peaster’s previous guide on how to lend crypto to institutions📖 Read Donovan’s Monday article: FTX is why we need more DeFi, not less",https://www.bankless.com/ultimate-guide-to-undercollateralized-lending-in-defi,,https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/2022/11/e09d7bcb-503e-4de2-bcbe-53b78223d7ec_2667x1500.webp,Ben Giove,Bankless,blog,Unknown Error,

USD-denominated TVL for GMX is up 9.9% from November 5.Source: DeFi LlamaWhen denominated in ETH, GMX’s TVL is up 41.0% since November 5!Source: DeFi LlamaMayhem and cascading insolvencies following the FTX fiasco erased value throughout the crypto ecosystem. Because of this, viewing TVL in terms of ETH can provide a more accurate proxy for a given protocol’s growth in crypto market share.For example, as GMX’s USD-denominated TVL fell 25.3% from November 5 to 10, while its ETH-denominated TVL rose by 12.1%!Temporary decreases in GMX’s USD-denominated TVL were direct results of systemic corollary factors (i.e., risks not unique to the Protocol). Increases in ETH-denominated TVL indicate a greater percentage of crypto assets made their way onto the platform during this period, increasing market share.Currently, GMX TVL is up, in terms of both USD and ETH, signaling that the platform has become a preferred choice for traders looking for decentralized alternatives to centralized exchanges.Arbitrum TVLGMX comprises over half of Arbitrum’s TVL. With this framing in mind, it is not shocking that Arbitrum’s TVL has been up only post-FTX.Source: DeFi LlamaWhat is shocking is that Arbitrum’s TVL, exclusive of GMX, has increased 7.6% from its pre-FTX high set on November 5.Source: DeFi Llama (Data Download)Why is this shocking?Let’s just say Layer 2 TVL recovery has been a little less ~optimistic~ when compared to Arbirtum: L2 USD-denominated TVL is 16.6% off its November 5 high.Source: L2BeatHigh fee revenue from GLP has turbocharged the Arbitrum ecosystem, boosting TVL. Yields generated from the asset’s fee structure serve as the backbone for the chain’s economy.Arbitrum developers depend on high GLP yields!Umami Finance, for example, is working towards launching vaults that hedge price risk for GLP, while continuing to provide users with the associated high yield.. Higher yields on GLP make this vault, and by extension the dApp, more attractive to DeFi users. Projects on Arbitrum benefit from deeper liquidity and bolstered valuations when GMX yields are attractive.The significance of yield earned on GLP to the ecosystem is evident in the resilience of the Arbirtum’s TVL to post-FTX drawdowns seen by competitive L2s.Leveraged Farming TVLSentiment and Gearbox launched on October 21 and 23, respectively, and appear primed to prove that this bear market is a build market!Both protocols allow users to access juiced yields on whitelisted DeFi protocols, via the aid of undercollateralized leverage (for more information on these protocols, check out The Ultimate Guide to Undercollateralized Lending in DeFi).The launch of these protocols, Gearbox in particular, was a positive catalysts for the sector’s TVL, which grew from $11.4M on October 23 to $119.9M on November 5 an increase of 🌕952%🌕!Source: DeFi LlamaUnfortunately, the collapse of FTX slammed the brakes on the rapid TVL growth displayed in the leveraged farming sector and contributed to the segment’s observed 20.3% peak-to-trough TVL drawdown. While the sector had yet to gap-up to November 6 ATHs at the time of analysis, it was within 1% on December 13, with $118.9M in TVL.High TVL seen is likely unsustainable in the leveraged farming sector over the long-term. Gearbox represents 94% of the sector’s TVL and HEAVILY subsidizes its yields!Source: GearboxThe Protocol rewards lenders with up to 6.66% APY in GEAR rewards on select pools to incentivize deposits.Diluting holders via token incentives is not a viable long-term strategy. While acquiring new users is essential to protocol success, failure to retain current users decimates a protocol’s community and can jeopardize the future of the project.Capital has flown into the leveraged farming sector because Gearbox, in particular, is a shiny new toy with token incentives attached. Unwinding these programs may result in TVL drawdowns for the sector.Polygon NFTsDid someone say collectible?Starbucks did! They just opened the Starbucks Odyssey to beta testers.Redditooors did, too. The number of unique Reddit Collectible Avatar holders has increased by 50% since November 5th.Source: Dune AnalyticsIn an industry flush with declining user counts and falling levels of on-chain activity, Polygon’s expansion into the branded collectible market has proven surprisingly successful. Mints, transfers, and sales of these low-value collectibles have mooned NFT activity on Polygon.Over 84k returning users purchased a Polygon NFT on OpenSea December 12, an increase of more than 🚀630%🚀 from November 5!Source: NansenAdditionally, the number of weekly OpenSea users and NFT minters increased by 178% from the week ending November 7: almost 245k Polygon addresses performed one of these actions over the past week. Source: NansenWhile these NFT projects masquerade under the guise of “collectibles” in an attempt to dissociate themselves with crypto’s perceived toxic culture, their success remains a testament to the viability of the NFTs and provides encouragement that corporates are moving to adopt and integrate blockchain technologies in their business models and loyalty programs.Stick around…Practically everything is down right now.Practically everything was down after 3AC blew up.Practically everything was down after the Fed raised rates.Practically everything was down after COVID became serious.Practically everything was down after the Chinese stock market crashed in 2015.Practically everything was down after the American housing market exploded in 2008.I could go on and on — I think I missed some events in between.

The Merge As previously mentioned the merge was a monumental technical achievement. Its impact on Ethereum cannot be overstated as it reduced energy consumption and ETH inflation by orders of magnitude while paving the way for future scalability upgrades. Watching the flawless execution of the merge live was surreal, and is certainly a moment that the community will never forget. 1. Ryan and David Meet Ladies & Gents… It happened. @BanklessHQ history has been made. pic.twitter.com/qIg4VMMPxQ — Lucas 🔥_🔥 (@0x_Lucas) May 16, 2022 While it may not have the same impact on the broader industry as the merge, Ryan and David meeting during Permissionless was undoubtedly the biggest moment of 2022. Despite spending hundreds of hours together on-screen, the two Bankless founding fathers had never met before that date. As someone who witnessed their first face-to-face interactions firsthand, I can truly say that it was a sight to behold. And I’m not just saying all this because they’re my bosses 😉. What A Year… As we can see, 2022 was one hell of a year. With prices in the gutter and Crypto Twitter deep in the throes of Goblin Town, it’s easy to focus on the worst people and events of 2022. And frankly, it’s understandable. The bad this year was really bad. However, it’s also important to remember the good, too. Long-term builders continued to ship, adoption grew, and crypto showed flashes of its incredible potential to serve as a tool for good. As Ryan said on the stream, 2022 needed to happen. Bad actors needed to be flushed out, and poorly run businesses washed away. We can now rebuild from first principles. Crypto can and will re-emerge stronger than ever. Here’s to a better ‘23. Action steps 👀 Watch the 2022 Top Moments livestream","Dear Bankless nation, Damn. What a year. As we inch closer to 2023, we’re feeling nostalgic and reflecting on what went right (and very, very wrong) in 2022.This week, Ryan and David delivered some livestreamed perspectives on the biggest moments of the year, which we’ve captured for you below. They divided up their highlights into four categories:The Biggest Heroes of 2022The Biggest Villains of 2022The Worst Moments of 2022The Best Moments of 2022Read along and then check out the recording to see who made an impact this year — for better or worse.- Bankless team2022 has certainly been one of the most… eventful… years in crypto’s history.The industry has dramatically changed over the course of the year as prices tumbled and the excesses of 2021 washed away.There’s so much to cover when trying to take inventory of 2022. But thankfully, Ryan and David decided to do it for us with their “2022's Biggest Crypto Moments” livestream.In addition to the big moments, they touched on a few bonus categories, such as crowning “gm” the meme of the year and awarding Gary Gensler the prestigious honor of “best supporting actor in a comedy” due to his laughable attempts at regulation, including his failure to identify and prevent the massive fraud at FTX, in 2022.As with all Bankless content, the stream is a must-watch.But for the old souls like myself who still prefer the written word, here’s the tl;dr of 2022’s biggest crypto moments. ⬇️🦸‍♂️ Top 5 Heroes5. Michael SaylorEveryone's favorite Bitcoin permabull takes the fifth spot on the list. Saylor has taken a $3.4B loss on the chin in 2022 as BTC has fallen more than 63% YTD. It’s fair to question Saylor’s strategy in light of his performance, but his conviction is admirable. Saylor has continued to buy throughout the downturn while shunning every other asset in existence. There is no second-best TradFi ape.4. Anthony SassanoWhile not as high-profile as Saylor, Anthony Sassano is certainly deserving of inclusion on this list. Sassano, runs The Daily Gwei newsletter and YouTube channel, where he provides free, educational content on all things Ethereum. Anthony is as consistent as the block production on the chain he covers, shipping highly informative content day in and day out.3. CobieCobie is known for being one of the most legendary traders in crypto, but in 2022 has shown himself to have quite the charitable side. Cobie made waves this year through his donations to Twitch streamers and for providing $100K in funding for the defense of atozy against a frivolous BitBoy lawsuit. In a true demonstration of his generosity, Cobie even let atozy keep the money after BitBoy dropped the suit.2. ZachXBTZachXBT has done god's work in 2022 as one of crypto’s best self-regulators. The anonymous on-chain sleuth has exposed a plethora of scams, rugs, and unethical business practices across the industry. ZachXBT’s actions are incredibly courageous, as he is taking considerable personal risk in publishing his exposés and doing his part to make crypto a safer and more ethical space.1. The Merge DevsThe Merge devs take the top spot on our heroes list. The devs, which include, Hsiao-Wei Wang, Parithosh Jayanthi, Marius Van Der Wijden, Ben Edgington, Tim Beiko and Danny Ryan managed to pull off one of the most monumental technical achievements in crypto history in transitioning Ethereum from Proof-Of-Work to Proof-Of-Stake. What makes this accomplishment even more impressive is that the merge went off without a hitch despite the complexity of the task, perpetual distractions with the insanity of 2022, and the high-stakes of handling a $200B+ network.🦹‍♂️ Top 5 Villains5. Richard HeartRichard Heart takes the fifth spot on our list. Heart not only is the man behind the highly controversial token HEX, but has also drawn the ire of many through his ostentatious and obnoxious displays of wealth.4. Alex MashinskyThe Celsius CEO ran his business into the ground due to incredibly poor risk management and excessive risk-taking. That wouldn't necessarily land him on this list, but Mashinsky and Celsius executives withdrew millions in funds in the weeks leading up to the platform pausing withdrawals and declaring bankruptcy. Mashinsky famously wore a shirt which said “bankers aren’t your friend.” That may be true, but Mashinsky certainly isn’t one either.3. Su Zhu and Kyle DaviesAs we’ve previously discussed, 3AC’s collapse wreaked havoc on the industry. So it's fitting that its outspoken co-founders and super-cycle proponents Su Zhu and Kyle Davies make our list, especially after allegations that they double pledged collateral and misrepresented their financial position to lenders. Su Zhu infamously tweeted that Ethereum abandoned its users…but it appears that 3AC abandoned its own creditors and morals in their thirst for leverage.2. Do KwonDo Kwon takes the second spot on our list. The algorithmic stablecoin founder compounded poor protocol design and reckless risk-management decisions like choosing to back UST with Bitcoin. Kwon didn't help matters through his tweets, infamously stating that by his hand “DAI would DAI” while directing an army of Lunatics towards any who dared to criticize him or his behavior.1. Sam Bankman-FriedThis should come as a surprise to no one, but SBF takes the cake for 2022’s worst villain. He stole $8B dollars and committed one of the worst financial crimes in human history. The recently arrested SBF has wreaked an incalculable amount of damage on the space. He is likely going to prison for a long, long time. Good riddance.🤮 Top 5 Worst Moments5. Tornado Cash SanctionsThere’s a reason why many in crypto feel the justice system is anything but just towards the industry. While many of crypto’s most egregious scammers and grifters walk free today, Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev was arrested in July following OFAC sanctions on the protocol. Imprisoned for simply creating code to protect privacy, a human right, Alexey’s arrest is one the most unjust events of 2022.4. The Collapse of TerraThe collapse of Terra was one of the largest capital destruction events in human history, with LUNA and UST losing more than ~$60B in combined value in a hyperinflationary death spiral. The algorithmic stablecoin’s implosion is terrible enough in its own right, but is even worse with hindsight as it catalyzed the credit crisis and ensuing contagion that wreaked havoc across CeFi.3. The Collapse of 3ACOnce a titan of industry, the fall of Three Arrows Capital had a devastating impact on the space. The hedge fund took out numerous undercollateralized loans in order to buy assets and employ unprofitable strategies like the GBTC discount trade. The 3AC meltdown led to a massive sell-off as their positions were liquidated, wiping out more than $1T in crypto market-cap and left a trail of CeFi bodies like Celsisus, BlockFi, and Voyager in its wake.2. The Ronin and Wormhole Cross-Chain HacksCross-chain bridges are insecure! It’s a lesson that we have learned time and time again as billions have been stolen in bridge hacks. Two of the largest casualties in 2022 were Wormhole, a cross-chain messaging protocol, and the bridge for Ronin, an L1 that hosts the P2E game Axie Infinity. More than $1B was stolen from these two protocols, with the Ronin hack being particularly egregious as it occurred due to improper private key management and helped spur the OFAC sanctions against Tornado Cash.1. The Collapse of FTXCould it be anything else?The FTX collapse revealed a massive fraud, as CEO Sam Bankman-Fried used customer deposits as his own personal slush fund to purchase real estate, invest in venture deals, make political donations and issue loans to his hedge-fund, Alameda Research. FTX will represent a stain on the industry over the coming months and years.But if there’s any silver lining from this situation, it’s that it has once again reminded us of the importance of decentralization and self-custody. NOT YOUR KEYS, NOT YOUR COINS.🏆 Top 5 Best Moments5. Crypto Supports UkraineCrypto demonstrated it can be a highly effective tool for facilitating political donations in a fast, efficient, and permissionless manner. Tens of millions were donated to support the defense of Ukraine, including a $6.5M sale of an NFT of the nation’s flag.4. L2s Flip L1s in Transaction ActivityWe may have been a year late, but we finally had an L2 summer (sort of). According to L2 Beat, in October the average transaction per second (TPS) on Layer 2’s surpassed that of Layer 1. Although we still have a ways to go when it comes to having enough blockspace to onboarding millions and billions, slowly but surely Etheruem is beginning to scale.3. Web2 Adopts NFTsA host of different Web2 businesses began to adopt NFTs in 2022, such as Reddit, Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter. Your normie friends may still hate them, but it's undeniable that the stage is being set for NFTs to be integrated into everyday life.2. The MergeAs previously mentioned the merge was a monumental technical achievement. Its impact on Ethereum cannot be overstated as it reduced energy consumption and ETH inflation by orders of magnitude while paving the way for future scalability upgrades. Watching the flawless execution of the merge live was surreal, and is certainly a moment that the community will never forget.1. Ryan and David MeetLadies & Gents…

It happened. @BanklessHQ history has been made. pic.twitter.com/qIg4VMMPxQ— Lucas 🔥_🔥 (@0x_Lucas) May 16, 2022

While it may not have the same impact on the broader industry as the merge, Ryan and David meeting during Permissionless was undoubtedly the biggest moment of 2022. Despite spending hundreds of hours together on-screen, the two Bankless founding fathers had never met before that date. As someone who witnessed their first face-to-face interactions firsthand, I can truly say that it was a sight to behold. And I’m not just saying all this because they’re my bosses 😉.What A Year…As we can see, 2022 was one hell of a year.With prices in the gutter and Crypto Twitter deep in the throes of Goblin Town, it’s easy to focus on the worst people and events of 2022. And frankly, it’s understandable. The bad this year was really bad.However, it’s also important to remember the good, too. Long-term builders continued to ship, adoption grew, and crypto showed flashes of its incredible potential to serve as a tool for good.As Ryan said on the stream, 2022 needed to happen. Bad actors needed to be flushed out, and poorly run businesses washed away.We can now rebuild from first principles. Crypto can and will re-emerge stronger than ever.Here’s to a better ‘23.Action steps👀 Watch the 2022 Top Moments livestream",https://www.bankless.com/the-biggest-crypto-moments-of-2022-2,2022-12-15T00:00:00.000Z,https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/2023/01/ca44d105-1259-4497-a970-46686dd08f8b_1890x1063.jpg,Bankless,Bankless,blog,Unknown Error,

I didn’t expect…A top 3 exchange to commit one of the worst frauds in historyThe biggest fund in crypto to be a massively overleveraged scamOne of the largest blockchains to drive it all to zero and be wanted by InterpolBut should we be surprised?While the specifics are never predictable, the 2022 craziness is exactly what the Bankless thesis predicts will happen when we put our trust in people instead of code.We don’t know which crypto bank will fail us…we just know they will fail.So we take take custody of our keys.We don’t know which trader god on twitter is just an overleveraged gambler.So we make thesis investments instead of chasing their narratives.We don’t know which blockchain technology will change the world next.But we know it’ll be the ones that prioritize decentralization.Protocols, not people.Code, not kings.We’re doubling-down on the core Bankless thesis in 2023. We won’t get all the specifics right. That’s impossible. But we have the right direction. The direction, as ever, is westward.We’re going bankless.- RSABankless 2023 PredictionsIt’s a new year and it’s time to make some grand predictions. We got many wrong last year… but really, who the hell could’ve predicted FTX?The good news is that’s not stopping us from laying down more bold predictions for the new year. Predictions, in hindsight, can be a useful gauge for just how deep into our echo chambers or misled by market sentiment we were.“What the hell were you thinking?” is a valuable question we don’t ask ourselves enough.So how’d we do with some of our overarching predictions going into 2022?❌ Crypto crosses new ATHs.✅ Eth2 merge happens.❌ Total market cap reaches $5T (highpoint remains $3T)✅ Bitcoin gets adopted by another nation-state (CAR did in June)❌ Ethereum becomes a trillion-dollar network. (only has reached $.56T)❌ Layer 2 reaches $25B in total value locked. (only reached $7B)✅ NFT sales hit $30B. (passed $30B by April—washtrading count?)❌ One DeFi Protocol will reach the top 10 in market cap.➖ DAOs will make an 8-figure purchase for an IRL item.

Brian is poised to be a knight-in-shining-armor.Sui, Aptos, or similar will gain traction and then break at scale.Ethereum will open physical stores (like Solana). I was a hater until I tried it and now I see some folks need an IRL experience to understand.CryptoPunks will moon.Bankless Labs will create two more web3-defining products - Earnifi brought over $150 million to folks with airdrop notifications, now we are expanding to more tech for your Bankless journey.Rachel Cusack - COOETH is going to flip Bitcoin.Lucas Matney - Editorial Dir.Things get worse at Twitter, Elon’s staunchest defenders in crypto distance themselves, Crypto Twitter still doesn’t move to decentralized social.Reddit quietly become major crypto player.The SEC takes aim at some crypto VC firms directly.Elizabeth Warren gives up on being the Senate’s face of aggressive crypto regulation, realizes that hating DeFi isn’t the progressive rallying cry she thinks it is.A non-Kardashian celebrity gets fined more than $1M for shilling a project.Apple continues war on crypto while quietly building team to figure out how they can monetize it in App Store.Lucas Campbell - Web3 leadENS crushes it on fundamentals (names registered, revenue, etc).Liquid staking outperforms market.Music NFTs continue to gain traction on the back of new artists and collectors entering the space. Music is collectible.Web3 social lays the groundwork for a bull market (similar to DeFi in 2019). Identity, social graphs, collectible content , etc. are all key pieces of this new social layer of the internet.Hot TCR Summer. Token Curated Registries, a crypto primitive hypothesized in the early days of Ethereum, finally begins to see some adoption (due to the wave in web3 social).Donovan Choy - EditorCBDCs get launched. They don’t really go anywhere, unless governments coercively tie them to essential payment services (like taxes).StarkNet underdelivers on performance relative to its L2 competitors.Censorship issues on Ethereum remain a thing of the past, technically speaking. Another black swan event like a Tornado Cash sanction might kick up a lot of ruckus, but there won’t be any existential censorship issues like in 2022.BTC doesn’t break 28.7K in 2023.I lose more money on crypto.Ben Giove - AnalystThe liquid staking DeFi sector sees massive growth post-Shanghai. Lido remains the market leader but loses significant share to challengers like Rocket Pool, StakeWise, Frax, and others. $RPL flips $LDO in market cap. All the LSD pure plays (LDO, RPL, SWISE) outperform ETH for the year.Ethereum L2s surpass $10B in total TVL, fueling a DeFi renaissance. Arbitrum becomes the second largest L1/L2 by TVL after they launch their token and GMX becomes a unicorn.A major L1 announces that they will become an Ethereum L2.We look back on November 9, 2022 as the crypto bottom and finish the year green. ETH never sees triple-digits again, hitting $3K at some point in 2023 before retracing.Jack Inabinet - AnalystA gridlocked Congress makes very little, if any, significant steps towards crypto regulation or legal clarity.Asset management protocols on Arbitrum gain wide adoption, fueled by yield on GLP.SBF is convicted.Dave Freiburger - Content Ops50% of Fortune 500 companies will enable ""pay with crypto"" and 15% will add connect wallet to their site or dip a toe into crypto/web3  via partnerships, dedicated features or NFTs.Twitter will be the wanna-be web3 company of the year. As it searches for more ways to make money, it will introduce more and more web3 products/features that other web2 companies will copy. Farcaster will pull away as the leading web3 social app, though.Moonbirds DAO will reach, not entirely so, but close to Nouns DAO level success.Kristi Klaudy - Community ManagerFurther consolidation of Bitcoin miners and tighter oligopoly marketDiscussions in the Bitcoin community flourish around improving Bitcoin security in the long term.

Index Coop will soon offer two structured products in liquid staking. The first is icETH, which has $13.3M in TVL and is a tokenized version of a recursive-leverage strategy using stETH and Aave. The second is dsETH, a soon-to-be-launched index of different liquid-staking derivatives (LSDs).Potential Price Impact:In leading to liquid staking and removing LSD “peg” concerns, the Shanghai upgrade is likely to drive growth in TVL for icETH and (eventually) dsETH, leading to increased revenues for Index Coop. With the DAO already profitable, having earned $477K over the past six months, and having no active liquidity mining programs, INDEX is in strong position to benefit from the “LSD trade.”➖ NeutralThese are tokens that we believe will perform in-line with the broader market over the next six-months.Frax Finance (FXS)Type: UpgradeSector: DeFi - StablecoinCurrent FDV: $499.7MFXS is being upgraded from underweight to neutral.Catalyst Overview:FXS is being upgraded due to the growth of Frax ETH.Frax ETH is a liquid staking service developed by the Frax team. The protocol utilizes a two token model, where users can stake their ETH to receive frxETH, a token pegged 1:1 to ETH which represents a claim on their underlying deposit. frxETH can then be staked for sfrxETH, which allows users to earn staking rewards. There have been 47,440 ETH staked into Frax ETH since its October 2022 launch, which represents a 0.25% share of total Beacon Chain deposits respectively.Potential Price Impact:Frax is poised to benefit from the growth in the liquid staking following Ethereum’s Shanghai network upgrade. As discussed above, Shanghai should lead to a dramatic increase in the ETH stake rate, and therefore inflows into liquid staking protocols. Frax, due to its ability to build out deep liquidity for frxETH and/or sfrxETH via its CVX holdings, is likely to capture a portion of these flows and as a result increase yields for veFXS holders, who will earn 8% of revenues generated by Frax ETH.While FXS has some long-term tail risk due to its use as seigniorage for the FRAX stablecoin, the growth of Frax ETH should enhance the returns of the token in the near-term.❌ UnderweightThese are tokens that we believe will underperform the broader market over the next six months.dYdX (DYDX)Type: DowngradeSector: DeFi - Perpetuals DEXCurrent FDV: $1.2BDYDX is being downgraded from neutral to underweight.Catalyst Overview:DYDX is being downgraded due to upcoming insider token unlocks.DYDX is facing significant unlocks in 2023, with the tokens circulating supply poised to increase 206% over the course of the year. This includes a major unlock on February 4, which will see 150M tokens, worth $183M at current prices, become unlocked for dYdX investors and team members.Potential Price Impact:These insider unlocks represent a significant source of ongoing sell pressure for DYDX, as it’s likely that a material portion of these assets will be sold on the open market at times when liquidity is scarce. Although the upcoming launch of dYdX V4 may create demand for DYDX due to its use as an L1 token, it’s unlikely that this will be enough to offset the tens, if not hundreds, of millions in sell-pressure over the coming months.The Sandbox (SAND)Type: Coverage InitiationSector: GameFiCurrent FDV: $1.3BWe are initiating coverage of SAND with a rating of underweight.Catalyst Overview:SAND is being assigned an underweight rating due to upcoming token unlocks.Like DYDX, SAND is also staring down the unlock barrel, with its circulating supply set to increase by 36% in 2023. The first these will occur on February 13, where 348M SAND, which accounts for 11.6% of the total supply and is worth $149.6M at current prices, will unlock as a part of vesting for team, investor, advisor, foundation, and “company reserve” allocations.Potential Price Impact:These unlocks may present a large source of continued sell-pressure for SAND, as it stands to reason that a portion of insider allocations will be sold onto the open market after the February unlock. Furthermore, between the project boasting few recent milestones, as well as reduced investor appetite in GameFi as a whole, the token has little upcoming catalysts to fuel interest in the token and help offset the risk of insider selling.📓 Bankless Token BibleYour essential resource for leveling up on crypto tokens and analysis.Access Bankless Token Bible 👈Covered Tokens - Their ratings are as follows:NOTE: We will no longer be providing analyst coverage on SYN, BAL, and TRIBE.This is NOT an indictment on SYN or BAL, but is instead being done so the analyst team can provide more-detailed coverage on a smaller number of tokens.

Today, we dig into Polygon’s partner success.- Bankless teamPolygon has been punching above its weight as of late.Over the course of 2022, they’ve onboarded some of the world’s largest brands – Starbucks, Reddit, and Meta – into the land of crypto and brought to life a new (albeit somewhat controversial) NFT format designed for non-crypto natives in the process, known as collectibles.Decrypt calls that Polygon’s “secret sauce.”Source: DecryptHow are the Web3 giga chads in the Polygon business development (BD) team bringing all of this real world crypto adoption?What’s Polygon’s Deal?Growing a decentralized network is no easy task. Beyond the most nascent of all crypto projects, few (if any) have obtained scale without financially supporting evangelists for the chain.Ethereum has the Ethereum Foundation.Source: Ethereum FoundationSolana has Solana Ventures (and formerly had an army of VCs bankrolling projects building on and migrating to the chain).Source: BlockworksIn the same vein, Polygon has Polygon Labs; the BD team is one of the groups within this organization.Much like the BD teams of traditional Web2 firms, Polygon BD finds new use cases and partnership opportunities for the chain and works with promising projects to onboard them into the community, providing technical assistance along the way.Polygon’s impending upgrade to a zkEVM is a highly complex and drastic core protocol change which invites technical questions and concerns from developers. Polygon Labs is there to showcase protocol development and future roadmap items to assuage transition-related unease.Polygon’s ProgressWhile crypto users went into retreat during 2022’s brutal bear market, USD-denominated DeFi TVL across all chains plummeted 75% off December 2021 highs.Yet, NFT user activity on Polygon proved to be a highlight for the chain in late 2022 as the BD team’s carefully crafted relations bore fruit and their partners’ projects gained adoption.Source: NansenFTX drama in November proved to be no hurdle for Polygon NFT user adoption, which saw exponential increases throughout the month and into December.Data Source: NansenFirst-time purchasing activity declined dramatically off of its highs while returning buyer activity held strong into the New Year, indicating that the number of new deployments has declined while existing projects have been successful at retaining users.How do Polygon’s BD relations fit into the story?Arguably, the most compelling adoption story for Polygon comes from its NFT collectibles partnership with Reddit.According to Dune Analytics, more than 6M unique user addresses hold Reddit collectibles, with over 8.4M avatars minted since the project’s launch and nearly every subsequent release achieving higher mint volumes than preceding drops, displaying clear user adoption.Reddit users minted nearly 500k avatar collectibles on December 16th alone!Source: Dune AnalyticsWhile Starbucks’ collectibles remain in the beta testing phase, a spokesperson for the company stated that they have seen “unprecedented interest in [the] Starbucks Odyssey” in combination with “overwhelming” customer responses and a massive beta tester waitlist.Despite its limited release, Starbucks’ Odyssey has done nearly $16k in trading volume, with a $290 floor price for the Project’s first “stamp.”Source: Nifty GatewayAs Terra’s implosion sent investors fleeing from crypto in May, Meta doubled down, announcing its pilot NFT program that would enable select creators to share their Ethereum and Polygon digital artwork with Instagram’s 1.28B users.On November 2, Meta stated it would provide creators with an end-to-end toolkit (launching natively with Polygon), empowering the creation, showcasing, and sale of their artwork.Despite hefty 15% to 30% platform fees, Instagram has proven successful in bridging the gap between Web2 platforms and Web3 technology, allowing users to purchase digital assets with fiat currencies..@AkuDreams NFTs sold out in 11 seconds on @instagram

The triumphs don’t end with collectibles either.Native Polygon support for Coinbase and Robinhood’s non-custodial wallet products is a direct result of Polygon Labs’ BD relations, and the team remains closely engaged with the exchanges to help unlock the powers of Polygon DeFi features to further enhance their product offerings.In CBDC land (commence audible Bankless reader groan), Polygon’s BD team has also made significant inroads.Project Guardian is the brainchild of Singapore’s central bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, and involved participation of JP Morgan Chase, Singapore-based DBS Bank, and Tokyo-based SBI Digital Asset Holdings, leveraging the support of Polygon Labs.The pilot program explored potential DeFi applications in wholesale funding markets, utilizing permissioned Aave pools to conduct Forex and government bond transactions against liquidity pools consisting of tokenized Singapore Government Securities Bonds, Japanese Government Bonds, Japanese Yen, and Singapore Dollars.JP Morgan issued Tokenized Singapore Dollars in the process, a general liability for the firm and the first instance of tokenized deposit issuance by a bank.3rd, we issued Tokenized Singapore Dollar Deposits! 💸This is a deposit token which is a general liability of JPM. It’s a native token giving stable on-chain value without the scalability issues of stablecoins. This is the 1st issuance of Tokenized Deposits by a Bank!— Ty Lobban (@TyLobban) November 2, 2022

According to Polygon's business development team, Project Guardian represented a significant milestone for Polygon Labs and is just one aspect of their burgeoning CBDC strategy, with several other projects looking to launch on Polygon.An Unnecessary Expenditure?Polygon Labs is funded via subsidies from the Polygon community treasury and does not create products or generate revenue on its own.Despite successful project implementations, CT has some outstanding questions regarding the group's methods to attract collaborators.“Bro the Polygon biz dev team are such chads”

The Polygon biz dev team: https://t.co/FdmiVcjnTp pic.twitter.com/FTEerpDUmF— Solo (@c0rellian) November 28, 2022

Like HR in a traditional corporation, Polygon Labs is a cost center.Simply because a group does not generate profits, however, does not mean that it is worthless. Running an Amazon-sized company without an HR department would be impossible!Cost centers provide value beyond profitability by facilitating operations for the broader organization.The question is does Polygon Labs provide enough value back to MATIC hodlers to justify the expense?Phrased alternatively: béchamel or steak sauce?Sauce It UpBéchamel sauce: a silky cream sauce that can be used either on its own or as the base for countless other sauces. One of five French “mother sauces” and key to some absolutely b*tchin’ Mac n’ Cheese.Steak sauce: Tang, but for meat. A great way to insult your host and/or ruin a good steak.So is the Polygon biz dev more béchamel or steak sauce?Do they improve the community by seeking out novel partnerships and use-cases? Or is their only function to drain the Polygon treasury, harming the chain’s competitiveness against alt L1s and substitute L2s?I am certainly not here to attest that every single dollar Polygon Labs has shelled out has been put to its best and highest use. For example, providing a $3M grant to get y00ts to migrate from Solana may not have been an optimal use of capital…Then again, I never was really into Soylana NFTs.What really excites me about Polygon’s BD is their ability to attract non-crypto native corporations and build real world partnerships.No one is even close to relationship building in Web 3.0 to @Fwiz and the team at Polygon 

Hands down the best biz dev in the industry— Josh.Bobrowsky.eth (@JoshBobrowsky) September 12, 2022

Not bullish on partnering with real world companies and onboarding normies into crypto, anon? First, please remember that every “crypto native” was once a “normie” too.Disagree. Betting on a single L2 for ETH is risky af. What if narrative and attention shifts to Arbitrum? Polygon got some biz dev deals with mainstream companies, but you know how fickle that is. Companies quick to associate and then distance themselves with web 3— oxy.sol (@oxydotsol) January 11, 2023

Sure, companies are quick to associate and disassociate their brand image with Web3 when all Joe Schmo sees is an industry filled with con artists and crypto grifters searching for their next quick buck. But these companies never truly associate themselves with Web3 in the first place!Instead, they distance themselves with snazzy marketing terms like “collectibles”, simply applying crypto’s tech and obfuscating the backend, packaging it in a user friendly format intended for the masses.It is the DeFi mullet thesis playing out in front of your eyes, just in a different form.Yes, the DeFi mullet is back.Blockchain tech provides novel property rights structures, faster settlement speeds, composability of protocols, and so much more that companies and central banks can co-opt into their business models — using them to design new products and build much deeper connections with their customers.What results is a highly symbiotic relationship between the Polygon chain and the trad firms building on it, with Polygon Labs providing the technical support needed for mega corporations to feel comfortable building on the chain.Yes, it is just a silly little collectible NFT for a coffee rewards program.But then it opens the door to so much more.To whom does Starbucks or Nike turn when they decide to implement in-store crypto payments? Where does DraftKings decide to build an on-chain sports book? On what chain do I receive my tickets to an NFL game or Disney cruise?All of these companies are Polygon partners and would more likely first approach the team they have crafted a long-standing relationship with and trust to provide the technical guidance required to secure billions of dollars in transactions and endless streams of user data.Relationships and trust are everything when it comes to doing business in traditional markets and take a very long time to build, especially when you come from an industry viewed by the mainstream as seedy and you are asking multi-billion dollar companies to commit resources, time, and money to building on your chain.If you wait to seek out partners in the bull market or when the use cases finally emerge, you will be too late!Idle USDC sitting in a treasury wallet doesn’t do anyone any favors and while not every BD expenditure can be guaranteed to be 100% necessary or prudent, that is simply the nature of crypto: you do not know what will prove profitable, forcing a spray-and-pray approach.Tech startups are frequently unprofitable. For Polygon, the decision to spend money today to build network effects tomorrow could translate to outsized success years down the road.In this writer’s opinion, Polygon Labs appears to be béchamel sauce quality ✅",https://www.bankless.com/how-is-polygon-doing-it,2023-01-19T00:00:00.000Z,https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/2023/01/326ddebc-06f0-463a-90ac-ade56cedecfe_2102x1182.jpg,Jack Inabinet,Bankless,blog,Unknown Error,

Previously on Polygon, the Protocol deployed to Arbitrum One on December 31 and TVL has been up only since, increasing 133% to $45M. At the time of analysis, the freshly launched Arbitrum deployment composed 61% of Gains Network’s TVL, with the Protocol’s gDAI vault becoming the largest holder of DAI on Arbitrum.Potential Price Impact:Arbitrum TVL has been on a tear! The success of GMX’s unique GLP fee structure has brought large amounts of stables and bluechip cryptos onto the chain, providing tailwind network effects to other protocols. A growing number of successful projects have brought native adoption to the chain, including TreasureDAO, Radiant, Camelot, and Rage Trade. Continued inflows into the Arbitrum universe will provide a greater amount of available collateral for gTrade. Gains Network is well positioned to continue to attract DeFi native trader attention from competitive products (i.e., GMX), due to increased leverage, a much broader range of tradable tickers, and usage of crypto-native collateral, providing continued support for GNS pricing.Lido (LDO)Author: Ben GioveType: ReiterationRisk Rating: LowRating Time Horizon: 3 monthsSector: Liquid StakingCurrent FDV: $2.3BWe are reiterating our overweight rating on LDO.Catalyst Overview:LDO remains overweight due to the upcoming Shanghai network upgrade.Shanghai is one of the most highly anticipated upgrades in Ethereum’s history, as it will enable withdrawals from staking. As of writing, 14.2% of the ETH supply is staked, with liquid staking protocols accounting for a 33.3% share of deposits. Lido is the largest staker on the Beacon Chain, with a 29.2% share of staked ETH and a 87.7% share within liquid staking.Potential Price Impact:Shanghai should help drive significant revenue growth for Lido, as by fully-derisking staking, the upgrade should lead to a significant inflow into LSDs. While Lido’s market share has trended down since the merge, and will face increasing competitive and social pressure to diversify stake, the massive inflows into liquid staking over the coming months means that the protocol should still benefit from a “rising tide lifts all” boats” environment.Rocket Pool (RPL)Author: Ben GioveType: ReiterationRisk Rating: LowRating Time Horizon: 3 monthsSector: Liquid StakingCurrent FDV: $800.5MWe are reiterating our overweight rating on RPL.Catalyst Overview:RPL remains overweight due to the upcoming Shanghai network upgrade.As discussed above, Shanghai is poised to lead to an influx in deposits for LSD issuers, as withdrawals will fully de-risk staking. Rocket Pool currently has a 2.3% and 6.9% share of total Beacon Chain and liquid staking deposits respectively.Potential Price Impact:Shanghai is set to catalyze inflows into Rocket Pool, and the decentralized protocol should benefit from not only the growth of the sector as a whole but the significant social push to diversify stake. In addition, Rocket Pool is set to benefit from its upcoming Atlas upgrade, which will lower the ETH collateral requirement from minipool operators from 16 to 8. This expected increase in the rETH supply will lead to an increase in demand for RPL, which must be bonded by minipool operators for use as slashing insurance.Canto (CANTO)Author: Ben GioveType: Coverage InitiationRisk Rating: HighRating Time Horizon: 6 monthsSector: L1Current FDV: $555.2MWe are initiating coverage of CANTO with a rating of overweight.Catalyst Overview:CANTO is being assigned this rating due the expectation of continued ecosystem growth.Canto has seen significant liquidity inflows to start 2023, with more than $104M in assets bridged into the network from Ethereum YTD. The L1 has also seen significant growth in other KPIs like active addresses, transactions, and fees. Canto is also seeing an increasing number of participants in the Canto Online Hackathon, with Season 5 of the event having more than 80 registrations compared to 13 in Season 4.Potential Price Impact:The Canto ecosystem looks set to grow over the coming months, as liquidity is flowing into the network and an increasing number of developers are leveraging the network's built-in DeFi primitives. While inflation from liquidity mining emissions could place some downward pressure on the token, an increase in demand for CANTO as the network grows should help offset some of this potential sell-pressure.Treasure DAO (MAGIC)Author: Ben GioveType: Coverage InitiationRisk Rating: MediumRating Time Horizon: 6 monthsSector: GameFiCurrent FDV: $689.8MWe are initiating coverage of MAGIC with a rating of overweight.Catalyst Overview:MAGIC is being assigned this rating due to the expected growth in the Treasure and Arbitrum ecosystems.There are numerous growth catalysts on the horizon within the Treasure ecosystem, such as an increase in adoption of The Beacon, an RPG game, and the launch of MagicSwap V2, an AMM which will support ERC-20 and ERC-721 trades within a single router. Arbitrum, the L2 in which Treasure is based, is also set to experience significant inflows in the coming months upon launch of the Arbitrum token and subsequent incentive programs.Potential Price Impact:The continued growth of games like The Beacon and launch of MagicSwap should drive long-term value to MAGIC, which is used as money within the Treasure ecosystem. Treasure should also benefit from the launch of Arbitrum’s token, of which they are likely to get a considerable allocation through either a direct airdrop or governance. Furthermore, MAGIC should benefit from less uncertainty surrounding unlocks, as a 14.3% supply unlock was completed on January 26.StakeWise (SWISE)Author: Ben GioveType: Coverage InitiationRisk Rating: HighRating Time Horizon: 6 monthsSector: Liquid StakingCurrent FDV: $150.1MWe are initiating coverage of SWISE with a rating of overweight.Catalyst Overview:StakeWise is being assigned this rating due to the Shanghai upgrade and launch of StakeWise V3.Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade will fully de-risk staking by enabling withdrawals, and is set to catalyze a boom in liquid staking as a result. StakeWise is currently the fifth largest liquid staking provider, with 1.3% market share within the sector and accounts for 0.4% of all Beacon Chain deposits. While it currently utilizes a two token model with permissioned validation, in the coming months StakeWise is set to launch V3, which will enable permissionless validation through the use of isolated vaults (similar to Uniswap or Fuse pools).Potential Price Impact:Shanghai and the launch of V3 are poised to lead to significant growth in StakeWise’s market share and revenues, with the decentralization and customizability of the protocol likely to attract both stakers and validators alike. In addition, the value created by V3 should more easily accrue to tokenholders, as a proposed tokenomics upgrade supported by the core team will allow SWISE holders to earn a share commissions from an individual vault in exchange for staking their tokens as slashing insurance.New Order DAO (NEWO)Author: Ben GioveType: Coverage InitiationRisk Rating: HighRating Time Horizon: 6 monthsSector: Venture DAOCurrent FDV: $25.0MWe are initiating coverage of NEWO with a rating of overweight.Catalyst Overview:New Order DAO is being assigned this rating due to the growth of [Redacted] Cartel and Y2K Finance.New Order’s two largest incubated projects are [Redacted] Cartel, a DeFi conglomerate, and Y2K Finance, a protocol for hedging/speculating on risk in pegged assets, with the two trading at FDVs of $198M and $41M respectively. New Order owns 5% of the BTRFLY supply and 10% of the Y2K supply, with its combined stakes being worth ~$14.0M at current prices.Potential Price Impact:The continued growth of Redacted and Y2K should help lead to long-term value accrual for the DAO treasury and veNEWO lockers, who in the future will earn 20% of yield generated from all treasury assets including these positions. This success of these two high profile incubees should also help increase the ability for New Order to attract and incubate high quality projects in the future. In addition, NEWO should also benefit from a narrowing of discount to RFV, as with a MC of $5.9M, the token is trading a 2.4x discount to the value of these positions alone.➖ NeutralThese are tokens that we believe will perform in-line with ETH.dYdX (DYDX)Author: Jack InabinetType: UpgradeRisk Rating: MediumRatings Time Horizon: 3 MonthsSector: DeFi - Perpetuals DEXCurrent FDV: $3.6BWe are upgrading DYDX from underweight to neutral.Catalyst Overview:DYDX is being upgraded due to the postponement of impending token unlocks.After announcing 150M of DYDX unlocks scheduled for February would be postponed until December 2023, with 30% of the original 150M DYDX tokens set to unlock on December 1 and the remaining via monthly unlocks thereafter, a major potential supply pressure was removed from the DYDX pricing equation. Currently, the circulating supply of DYDX is 148M: scheduled unlocks would have doubled this! The driving factor for Bankless’s underweight rating was impending unlocks, now a near-term non-factor.Potential Price Impact:Note the 3 month rating timeline, anon!While the price of DYDX will likely appreciate in the near-term, the team is employing emergency stopgap measures to protect token price, currently down 88% from its ATH. dYdX V4 is set to launch as a stand-alone Cosmos-based chain. If the team intends to use DYDX as the fee token of its chain, it is crucial to inflate token PRICE as much as possible to avoid inflating token SUPPLY to secure the network; postponement of unlocks shows that this may be their intent. DYDX continues to face longer-term structural headwinds from looming unlocks and potential token inflation to secure the dYdX chain. The can has simply been kicked down the road, not removed from the equation!❌ UnderweightThese are tokens that we believe will underperform ETH over the next six months.SushiSwap (SUSHI)Author: Jack InabinetType: ReiterationRelative Risk Rating: HighRatings Time Horizon: 6 MonthsSector: DeFi - Spot DEXCurrent FDV: $349.3MWe are reiterating our underweight rating on SUSHI.Catalyst Overview:SUSHI continues to face strong headwinds after the Protocol voted to divert 100% of protocol fee revenue to the treasury.SushiSwap Head Chef Jared Gray noted in December that failures to diversify the community treasury, despite best efforts to cut costs, left the project with approximately 1.5 years of runway for operations. By tapping into 100% of protocol revenue, Gray hoped to enable continuous operation for the foreseeable future. Prior to this change, 90% of revenue went to xSUSHI stakers, with 10% remitted to the treasury.Currently, the SushiSwap team incurs $5M in annual expenditures.Potential Price Impact:Deprecation of the Kanpai fee share removed a positive influence on SUSHI price. While it is possible to argue that by doing so, SushiSwap bolstered its longevity and the move can be viewed as a net positive, we believe that this action attests to ongoing struggles faced by the Protocol.SushiSwap is gasping for its last breath of air, not engaging in shrewd governance. In a market saturated with more established names and upstart DEXs alike, SushiSwap is simply losing its edge. While Gray sees up to 1.5 years of runway, volatile crypto market conditions could truncate this projection. Currently, nearly 90% of the SushiSwap treasury is composed of non-stable assets, with 84% represented by native SUSHI and xSUSHI tokens. Continued struggles at SushiSwap would not bode well for the value of SUSHI or the runway. SUSHI may be on its last legs.🏦 Introducing Bankless FundThe Token Ratings and Token Bible are getting an upgrade.We are excited to announce that we are integrating Bankless Fund, a private investment club made up of Bankless team members, into the Token Bible!The Bankless Fund is how we put our own skin in the game with our Token Ratings, as it takes long positions in what we feel are our highest conviction, highest upside (and therefore highest risk) overweights.Bankless Premium subscribers will get an exclusive peek behind the curtain, as we will be publishing our thesis behind each Bankless Fund investment in the Token Bible.NOTE: YOU CANNOT INVEST IN THE BANKLESS FUND.

Each project's risk is measured relative to the other tokens covered in the Token Bible.The risk scale is as follows:🟢 Lower Risk: Lower risk profile relative to others covered here.🟡 Moderate Risk: Average risk profile relative to others covered here.🔴 Higher Risk: Higher risk profile relative to others covered here.✅ OverweightThese are tokens that we believe will outperform ETH.Gains Network (GNS)Author: Jack InabinetType: Coverage InitiationRisk Rating: MediumRating Time Horizon: 6 monthsSector: DeFi - Perpetuals DEXCurrent FDV: $192.1MWe are initiating coverage of GNS with a rating of overweight.Catalyst Overview:GNS coverage is being initiated with a rating of overweight due to the protocol’s successful launch on Arbitrum.Gains Network’s gTrade exchange gives users the ability to take up to 30-150x leverage on a wide variety of alts, bluechips, and stocks, with 1000x leverage on Forex pairs! Previously on Polygon, the Protocol deployed to Arbitrum One on December 31 and TVL has been up only since, increasing 133% to $45M. At the time of analysis, the freshly launched Arbitrum deployment composed 61% of Gains Network’s TVL, with the Protocol’s gDAI vault becoming the largest holder of DAI on Arbitrum.Potential Price Impact:Arbitrum TVL has been on a tear! The success of GMX’s unique GLP fee structure has brought large amounts of stables and bluechip cryptos onto the chain, providing tailwind network effects to other protocols. A growing number of successful projects have brought native adoption to the chain, including TreasureDAO, Radiant, Camelot, and Rage Trade. Continued inflows into the Arbitrum universe will provide a greater amount of available collateral for gTrade. Gains Network is well positioned to continue to attract DeFi native trader attention from competitive products (i.e., GMX), due to increased leverage, a much broader range of tradable tickers, and usage of crypto-native collateral, providing continued support for GNS pricing.Lido (LDO)Author: Ben GioveType: ReiterationRisk Rating: LowRating Time Horizon: 3 monthsSector: Liquid StakingCurrent FDV: $2.3BWe are reiterating our overweight rating on LDO.Catalyst Overview:LDO remains overweight due to the upcoming Shanghai network upgrade.Shanghai is one of the most highly anticipated upgrades in Ethereum’s history, as it will enable withdrawals from staking. As of writing, 14.2% of the ETH supply is staked, with liquid staking protocols accounting for a 33.3% share of deposits. Lido is the largest staker on the Beacon Chain, with a 29.2% share of staked ETH and a 87.7% share within liquid staking.Potential Price Impact:Shanghai should help drive significant revenue growth for Lido, as by fully-derisking staking, the upgrade should lead to a significant inflow into LSDs. While Lido’s market share has trended down since the merge, and will face increasing competitive and social pressure to diversify stake, the massive inflows into liquid staking over the coming months means that the protocol should still benefit from a “rising tide lifts all” boats” environment.Rocket Pool (RPL)Author: Ben GioveType: ReiterationRisk Rating: LowRating Time Horizon: 3 monthsSector: Liquid StakingCurrent FDV: $800.5MWe are reiterating our overweight rating on RPL.Catalyst Overview:RPL remains overweight due to the upcoming Shanghai network upgrade.As discussed above, Shanghai is poised to lead to an influx in deposits for LSD issuers, as withdrawals will fully de-risk staking. Rocket Pool currently has a 2.3% and 6.9% share of total Beacon Chain and liquid staking deposits respectively.Potential Price Impact:Shanghai is set to catalyze inflows into Rocket Pool, and the decentralized protocol should benefit from not only the growth of the sector as a whole but the significant social push to diversify stake. In addition, Rocket Pool is set to benefit from its upcoming Atlas upgrade, which will lower the ETH collateral requirement from minipool operators from 16 to 8. This expected increase in the rETH supply will lead to an increase in demand for RPL, which must be bonded by minipool operators for use as slashing insurance.Canto (CANTO)Author: Ben GioveType: Coverage InitiationRisk Rating: HighRating Time Horizon: 6 monthsSector: L1Current FDV: $555.2MWe are initiating coverage of CANTO with a rating of overweight.Catalyst Overview:CANTO is being assigned this rating due the expectation of continued ecosystem growth.Canto has seen significant liquidity inflows to start 2023, with more than $104M in assets bridged into the network from Ethereum YTD. The L1 has also seen significant growth in other KPIs like active addresses, transactions, and fees. Canto is also seeing an increasing number of participants in the Canto Online Hackathon, with Season 5 of the event having more than 80 registrations compared to 13 in Season 4.Potential Price Impact:The Canto ecosystem looks set to grow over the coming months, as liquidity is flowing into the network and an increasing number of developers are leveraging the network's built-in DeFi primitives. While inflation from liquidity mining emissions could place some downward pressure on the token, an increase in demand for CANTO as the network grows should help offset some of this potential sell-pressure.Treasure DAO (MAGIC)Author: Ben GioveType: Coverage InitiationRisk Rating: MediumRating Time Horizon: 6 monthsSector: GameFiCurrent FDV: $689.8MWe are initiating coverage of MAGIC with a rating of overweight.Catalyst Overview:MAGIC is being assigned this rating due to the expected growth in the Treasure and Arbitrum ecosystems.There are numerous growth catalysts on the horizon within the Treasure ecosystem, such as an increase in adoption of The Beacon, an RPG game, and the launch of MagicSwap V2, an AMM which will support ERC-20 and ERC-721 trades within a single router. Arbitrum, the L2 in which Treasure is based, is also set to experience significant inflows in the coming months upon launch of the Arbitrum token and subsequent incentive programs.Potential Price Impact:The continued growth of games like The Beacon and launch of MagicSwap should drive long-term value to MAGIC, which is used as money within the Treasure ecosystem. Treasure should also benefit from the launch of Arbitrum’s token, of which they are likely to get a considerable allocation through either a direct airdrop or governance. Furthermore, MAGIC should benefit from less uncertainty surrounding unlocks, as a 14.3% supply unlock was completed on January 26.StakeWise (SWISE)Author: Ben GioveType: Coverage InitiationRisk Rating: HighRating Time Horizon: 6 monthsSector: Liquid StakingCurrent FDV: $150.1MWe are initiating coverage of SWISE with a rating of overweight.Catalyst Overview:StakeWise is being assigned this rating due to the Shanghai upgrade and launch of StakeWise V3.Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade will fully de-risk staking by enabling withdrawals, and is set to catalyze a boom in liquid staking as a result. StakeWise is currently the fifth largest liquid staking provider, with 1.3% market share within the sector and accounts for 0.4% of all Beacon Chain deposits. While it currently utilizes a two token model with permissioned validation, in the coming months StakeWise is set to launch V3, which will enable permissionless validation through the use of isolated vaults (similar to Uniswap or Fuse pools).Potential Price Impact:Shanghai and the launch of V3 are poised to lead to significant growth in StakeWise’s market share and revenues, with the decentralization and customizability of the protocol likely to attract both stakers and validators alike. In addition, the value created by V3 should more easily accrue to tokenholders, as a proposed tokenomics upgrade supported by the core team will allow SWISE holders to earn a share commissions from an individual vault in exchange for staking their tokens as slashing insurance.New Order DAO (NEWO)Author: Ben GioveType: Coverage InitiationRisk Rating: HighRating Time Horizon: 6 monthsSector: Venture DAOCurrent FDV: $25.0MWe are initiating coverage of NEWO with a rating of overweight.Catalyst Overview:New Order DAO is being assigned this rating due to the growth of [Redacted] Cartel and Y2K Finance.New Order’s two largest incubated projects are [Redacted] Cartel, a DeFi conglomerate, and Y2K Finance, a protocol for hedging/speculating on risk in pegged assets, with the two trading at FDVs of $198M and $41M respectively. New Order owns 5% of the BTRFLY supply and 10% of the Y2K supply, with its combined stakes being worth ~$14.0M at current prices.Potential Price Impact:The continued growth of Redacted and Y2K should help lead to long-term value accrual for the DAO treasury and veNEWO lockers, who in the future will earn 20% of yield generated from all treasury assets including these positions. This success of these two high profile incubees should also help increase the ability for New Order to attract and incubate high quality projects in the future. In addition, NEWO should also benefit from a narrowing of discount to RFV, as with a MC of $5.9M, the token is trading a 2.4x discount to the value of these positions alone.➖ NeutralThese are tokens that we believe will perform in-line with ETH.dYdX (DYDX)Author: Jack InabinetType: UpgradeRisk Rating: MediumRatings Time Horizon: 3 MonthsSector: DeFi - Perpetuals DEXCurrent FDV: $3.6BWe are upgrading DYDX from underweight to neutral.Catalyst Overview:DYDX is being upgraded due to the postponement of impending token unlocks.After announcing 150M of DYDX unlocks scheduled for February would be postponed until December 2023, with 30% of the original 150M DYDX tokens set to unlock on December 1 and the remaining via monthly unlocks thereafter, a major potential supply pressure was removed from the DYDX pricing equation. Currently, the circulating supply of DYDX is 148M: scheduled unlocks would have doubled this! The driving factor for Bankless’s underweight rating was impending unlocks, now a near-term non-factor.Potential Price Impact:Note the 3 month rating timeline, anon!While the price of DYDX will likely appreciate in the near-term, the team is employing emergency stopgap measures to protect token price, currently down 88% from its ATH. dYdX V4 is set to launch as a stand-alone Cosmos-based chain. If the team intends to use DYDX as the fee token of its chain, it is crucial to inflate token PRICE as much as possible to avoid inflating token SUPPLY to secure the network; postponement of unlocks shows that this may be their intent. DYDX continues to face longer-term structural headwinds from looming unlocks and potential token inflation to secure the dYdX chain. The can has simply been kicked down the road, not removed from the equation!❌ UnderweightThese are tokens that we believe will underperform ETH over the next six months.SushiSwap (SUSHI)Author: Jack InabinetType: ReiterationRelative Risk Rating: HighRatings Time Horizon: 6 MonthsSector: DeFi - Spot DEXCurrent FDV: $349.3MWe are reiterating our underweight rating on SUSHI.Catalyst Overview:SUSHI continues to face strong headwinds after the Protocol voted to divert 100% of protocol fee revenue to the treasury.SushiSwap Head Chef Jared Gray noted in December that failures to diversify the community treasury, despite best efforts to cut costs, left the project with approximately 1.5 years of runway for operations. By tapping into 100% of protocol revenue, Gray hoped to enable continuous operation for the foreseeable future. Prior to this change, 90% of revenue went to xSUSHI stakers, with 10% remitted to the treasury.Currently, the SushiSwap team incurs $5M in annual expenditures.Potential Price Impact:Deprecation of the Kanpai fee share removed a positive influence on SUSHI price. While it is possible to argue that by doing so, SushiSwap bolstered its longevity and the move can be viewed as a net positive, we believe that this action attests to ongoing struggles faced by the Protocol.SushiSwap is gasping for its last breath of air, not engaging in shrewd governance. In a market saturated with more established names and upstart DEXs alike, SushiSwap is simply losing its edge. While Gray sees up to 1.5 years of runway, volatile crypto market conditions could truncate this projection. Currently, nearly 90% of the SushiSwap treasury is composed of non-stable assets, with 84% represented by native SUSHI and xSUSHI tokens. Continued struggles at SushiSwap would not bode well for the value of SUSHI or the runway. SUSHI may be on its last legs.🏦 Introducing Bankless FundThe Token Ratings and Token Bible are getting an upgrade.We are excited to announce that we are integrating Bankless Fund, a private investment club made up of Bankless team members, into the Token Bible!The Bankless Fund is how we put our own skin in the game with our Token Ratings, as it takes long positions in what we feel are our highest conviction, highest upside (and therefore highest risk) overweights.Bankless Premium subscribers will get an exclusive peek behind the curtain, as we will be publishing our thesis behind each Bankless Fund investment in the Token Bible.NOTE: YOU CANNOT INVEST IN THE BANKLESS FUND.

It also updates coverage on DYDX while reiterating coverage on LDO, RPL, and SUSHI.Below, we’ll discuss the rationale behind each rating by delving into the driving catalysts and their potential impact on the token’s price.We are also providing a comprehensive overview of many of the tokens we cover via the Bankless Token Bible!📓 Token Bible access at the bottom of this report. Bankless Premium only! Bankless Fund positions and their respective investment theses are also included in the Token Bible (more on this later).The Token Bible is an investor’s “cheat-sheet” as it’s a one-stop-shop where you can get access to all of the ratings and historical notes for each token covered by the analyst team.Explaining Our Rating Scales and Risk ScalesBefore we dive into the coverage and ratings, let’s take a moment to explain our rating scale. The ratings reflect how we expect each token will perform over a specified (3 or 6 month) time horizon relative to the performance of ETH. It is not indicative of our opinion on the long-run potential of each token.The rating scale is as follows:✅ Overweight: We expect this token to outperform ETH.➖ Neutral: We expect this token to perform in-line with ETH.❌ Underweight: We expect this token to underperform ETH.Beginning with this edition, we are also introducing Risk Ratings. These Risk Ratings represent our holistic assessment of the risks associated with each token, including factors such as product traction, valuation, and token liquidity. Each project's risk is measured relative to the other tokens covered in the Token Bible.The risk scale is as follows:🟢 Lower Risk: Lower risk profile relative to others covered here.🟡 Moderate Risk: Average risk profile relative to others covered here.🔴 Higher Risk: Higher risk profile relative to others covered here.✅ OverweightThese are tokens that we believe will outperform ETH.Gains Network (GNS)Author: Jack InabinetType: Coverage InitiationRisk Rating: MediumRating Time Horizon: 6 monthsSector: DeFi - Perpetuals DEXCurrent FDV: $192.1MWe are initiating coverage of GNS with a rating of overweight.Catalyst Overview:GNS coverage is being initiated with a rating of overweight due to the protocol’s successful launch on Arbitrum.Gains Network’s gTrade exchange gives users the ability to take up to 30-150x leverage on a wide variety of alts, bluechips, and stocks, with 1000x leverage on Forex pairs!

There are numerous growth catalysts on the horizon within the Treasure ecosystem, such as an increase in adoption of The Beacon, an RPG game, and the launch of MagicSwap V2, an AMM which will support ERC-20 and ERC-721 trades within a single router. Arbitrum, the L2 in which Treasure is based, is also set to experience significant inflows in the coming months upon launch of the Arbitrum token and subsequent incentive programs. Potential Price Impact: The continued growth of games like The Beacon and launch of MagicSwap should drive long-term value to MAGIC, which is used as money within the Treasure ecosystem. Treasure should also benefit from the launch of Arbitrum’s token, of which they are likely to get a considerable allocation through either a direct airdrop or governance. Furthermore, MAGIC should benefit from less uncertainty surrounding unlocks, as a 14.3% supply unlock was completed on January 26.

It also updates coverage on DYDX while reiterating coverage on LDO, RPL, and SUSHI.Below, we’ll discuss the rationale behind each rating by delving into the driving catalysts and their potential impact on the token’s price.We are also providing a comprehensive overview of many of the tokens we cover via the Bankless Token Bible!📓 Token Bible access at the bottom of this report. Bankless Premium only! Bankless Fund positions and their respective investment theses are also included in the Token Bible (more on this later).The Token Bible is an investor’s “cheat-sheet” as it’s a one-stop-shop where you can get access to all of the ratings and historical notes for each token covered by the analyst team.Explaining Our Rating Scales and Risk ScalesBefore we dive into the coverage and ratings, let’s take a moment to explain our rating scale. The ratings reflect how we expect each token will perform over a specified (3 or 6 month) time horizon relative to the performance of ETH. It is not indicative of our opinion on the long-run potential of each token.The rating scale is as follows:✅ Overweight: We expect this token to outperform ETH.➖ Neutral: We expect this token to perform in-line with ETH.❌ Underweight: We expect this token to underperform ETH.Beginning with this edition, we are also introducing Risk Ratings. These Risk Ratings represent our holistic assessment of the risks associated with each token, including factors such as product traction, valuation, and token liquidity. Each project's risk is measured relative to the other tokens covered in the Token Bible.The risk scale is as follows:🟢 Lower Risk: Lower risk profile relative to others covered here.🟡 Moderate Risk: Average risk profile relative to others covered here.🔴 Higher Risk: Higher risk profile relative to others covered here.✅ OverweightThese are tokens that we believe will outperform ETH.Gains Network (GNS)Author: Jack InabinetType: Coverage InitiationRisk Rating: MediumRating Time Horizon: 6 monthsSector: DeFi - Perpetuals DEXCurrent FDV: $192.1MWe are initiating coverage of GNS with a rating of overweight.Catalyst Overview:GNS coverage is being initiated with a rating of overweight due to the protocol’s successful launch on Arbitrum.Gains Network’s gTrade exchange gives users the ability to take up to 30-150x leverage on a wide variety of alts, bluechips, and stocks, with 1000x leverage on Forex pairs! Previously on Polygon, the Protocol deployed to Arbitrum One on December 31 and TVL has been up only since, increasing 133% to $45M. At the time of analysis, the freshly launched Arbitrum deployment composed 61% of Gains Network’s TVL, with the Protocol’s gDAI vault becoming the largest holder of DAI on Arbitrum.Potential Price Impact:Arbitrum TVL has been on a tear! The success of GMX’s unique GLP fee structure has brought large amounts of stables and bluechip cryptos onto the chain, providing tailwind network effects to other protocols. A growing number of successful projects have brought native adoption to the chain, including TreasureDAO, Radiant, Camelot, and Rage Trade. Continued inflows into the Arbitrum universe will provide a greater amount of available collateral for gTrade. Gains Network is well positioned to continue to attract DeFi native trader attention from competitive products (i.e., GMX), due to increased leverage, a much broader range of tradable tickers, and usage of crypto-native collateral, providing continued support for GNS pricing.Lido (LDO)Author: Ben GioveType: ReiterationRisk Rating: LowRating Time Horizon: 3 monthsSector: Liquid StakingCurrent FDV: $2.3BWe are reiterating our overweight rating on LDO.Catalyst Overview:LDO remains overweight due to the upcoming Shanghai network upgrade.Shanghai is one of the most highly anticipated upgrades in Ethereum’s history, as it will enable withdrawals from staking. As of writing, 14.2% of the ETH supply is staked, with liquid staking protocols accounting for a 33.3% share of deposits. Lido is the largest staker on the Beacon Chain, with a 29.2% share of staked ETH and a 87.7% share within liquid staking.Potential Price Impact:Shanghai should help drive significant revenue growth for Lido, as by fully-derisking staking, the upgrade should lead to a significant inflow into LSDs. While Lido’s market share has trended down since the merge, and will face increasing competitive and social pressure to diversify stake, the massive inflows into liquid staking over the coming months means that the protocol should still benefit from a “rising tide lifts all” boats” environment.Rocket Pool (RPL)Author: Ben GioveType: ReiterationRisk Rating: LowRating Time Horizon: 3 monthsSector: Liquid StakingCurrent FDV: $800.5MWe are reiterating our overweight rating on RPL.Catalyst Overview:RPL remains overweight due to the upcoming Shanghai network upgrade.As discussed above, Shanghai is poised to lead to an influx in deposits for LSD issuers, as withdrawals will fully de-risk staking. Rocket Pool currently has a 2.3% and 6.9% share of total Beacon Chain and liquid staking deposits respectively.Potential Price Impact:Shanghai is set to catalyze inflows into Rocket Pool, and the decentralized protocol should benefit from not only the growth of the sector as a whole but the significant social push to diversify stake. In addition, Rocket Pool is set to benefit from its upcoming Atlas upgrade, which will lower the ETH collateral requirement from minipool operators from 16 to 8. This expected increase in the rETH supply will lead to an increase in demand for RPL, which must be bonded by minipool operators for use as slashing insurance.Canto (CANTO)Author: Ben GioveType: Coverage InitiationRisk Rating: HighRating Time Horizon: 6 monthsSector: L1Current FDV: $555.2MWe are initiating coverage of CANTO with a rating of overweight.Catalyst Overview:CANTO is being assigned this rating due the expectation of continued ecosystem growth.Canto has seen significant liquidity inflows to start 2023, with more than $104M in assets bridged into the network from Ethereum YTD. The L1 has also seen significant growth in other KPIs like active addresses, transactions, and fees. Canto is also seeing an increasing number of participants in the Canto Online Hackathon, with Season 5 of the event having more than 80 registrations compared to 13 in Season 4.Potential Price Impact:The Canto ecosystem looks set to grow over the coming months, as liquidity is flowing into the network and an increasing number of developers are leveraging the network's built-in DeFi primitives. While inflation from liquidity mining emissions could place some downward pressure on the token, an increase in demand for CANTO as the network grows should help offset some of this potential sell-pressure.Treasure DAO (MAGIC)Author: Ben GioveType: Coverage InitiationRisk Rating: MediumRating Time Horizon: 6 monthsSector: GameFiCurrent FDV: $689.8MWe are initiating coverage of MAGIC with a rating of overweight.Catalyst Overview:MAGIC is being assigned this rating due to the expected growth in the Treasure and Arbitrum ecosystems.There are numerous growth catalysts on the horizon within the Treasure ecosystem, such as an increase in adoption of The Beacon, an RPG game, and the launch of MagicSwap V2, an AMM which will support ERC-20 and ERC-721 trades within a single router.

StakeWise is currently the fifth largest liquid staking provider, with 1.3% market share within the sector and accounts for 0.4% of all Beacon Chain deposits.

In addition, the value created by V3 should more easily accrue to tokenholders, as a proposed tokenomics upgrade supported by the core team will allow SWISE holders to earn a share commissions from an individual vault in exchange for staking their tokens as slashing insurance.New Order DAO (NEWO)Author: Ben GioveType: Coverage InitiationRisk Rating: HighRating Time Horizon: 6 monthsSector: Venture DAOCurrent FDV: $25.0MWe are initiating coverage of NEWO with a rating of overweight.Catalyst Overview:New Order DAO is being assigned this rating due to the growth of [Redacted] Cartel and Y2K Finance.New Order’s two largest incubated projects are [Redacted] Cartel, a DeFi conglomerate, and Y2K Finance, a protocol for hedging/speculating on risk in pegged assets, with the two trading at FDVs of $198M and $41M respectively. New Order owns 5% of the BTRFLY supply and 10% of the Y2K supply, with its combined stakes being worth ~$14.0M at current prices.Potential Price Impact:The continued growth of Redacted and Y2K should help lead to long-term value accrual for the DAO treasury and veNEWO lockers, who in the future will earn 20% of yield generated from all treasury assets including these positions. This success of these two high profile incubees should also help increase the ability for New Order to attract and incubate high quality projects in the future.

Currently, the circulating supply of DYDX is 148M: scheduled unlocks would have doubled this! The driving factor for Bankless’s underweight rating was impending unlocks, now a near-term non-factor.Potential Price Impact:Note the 3 month rating timeline, anon!While the price of DYDX will likely appreciate in the near-term, the team is employing emergency stopgap measures to protect token price, currently down 88% from its ATH. dYdX V4 is set to launch as a stand-alone Cosmos-based chain. If the team intends to use DYDX as the fee token of its chain, it is crucial to inflate token PRICE as much as possible to avoid inflating token SUPPLY to secure the network; postponement of unlocks shows that this may be their intent.

By tapping into 100% of protocol revenue, Gray hoped to enable continuous operation for the foreseeable future. Prior to this change, 90% of revenue went to xSUSHI stakers, with 10% remitted to the treasury.Currently, the SushiSwap team incurs $5M in annual expenditures.Potential Price Impact:Deprecation of the Kanpai fee share removed a positive influence on SUSHI price.

Catalyst Overview: DYDX is being upgraded due to the postponement of impending token unlocks. After announcing 150M of DYDX unlocks scheduled for February would be postponed until December 2023, with 30% of the original 150M DYDX tokens set to unlock on December 1 and the remaining via monthly unlocks thereafter, a major potential supply pressure was removed from the DYDX pricing equation. Currently, the circulating supply of DYDX is 148M: scheduled unlocks would have doubled this! The driving factor for Bankless’s underweight rating was impending unlocks, now a near-term non-factor. Potential Price Impact: Note the 3 month rating timeline, anon! While the price of DYDX will likely appreciate in the near-term, the team is employing emergency stopgap measures to protect token price, currently down 88% from its ATH. dYdX V4 is set to launch as a stand-alone Cosmos-based chain. If the team intends to use DYDX as the fee token of its chain, it is crucial to inflate token PRICE as much as possible to avoid inflating token SUPPLY to secure the network; postponement of unlocks shows that this may be their intent. DYDX continues to face longer-term structural headwinds from looming unlocks and potential token inflation to secure the dYdX chain. The can has simply been kicked down the road, not removed from the equation! ❌ Underweight These are tokens that we believe will underperform ETH over the next six months.","Dear Bankless Nation,It’s the first Friday of the month, which means it’s time for a Token Ratings update!We’ve got some exciting new developments (more below) and an extra helping of coverage additions this time 🎉This month we’re covering:🆕 GNS, CANTO, MAGIC, SWISE, NEWO🔄 DYDX, LDO, RPL, SUSHIAs usual, the first token is open for everyone, the rest are exclusive for ✨Bankless Premium subscribers✨.- Bankless TeamThis report initiates analyst coverage on GNS, CANTO, MAGIC, SWISE and NEWO. It also updates coverage on DYDX while reiterating coverage on LDO, RPL, and SUSHI.Below, we’ll discuss the rationale behind each rating by delving into the driving catalysts and their potential impact on the token’s price.We are also providing a comprehensive overview of many of the tokens we cover via the Bankless Token Bible!📓 Token Bible access at the bottom of this report. Bankless Premium only! Bankless Fund positions and their respective investment theses are also included in the Token Bible (more on this later).The Token Bible is an investor’s “cheat-sheet” as it’s a one-stop-shop where you can get access to all of the ratings and historical notes for each token covered by the analyst team.Explaining Our Rating Scales and Risk ScalesBefore we dive into the coverage and ratings, let’s take a moment to explain our rating scale. The ratings reflect how we expect each token will perform over a specified (3 or 6 month) time horizon relative to the performance of ETH. It is not indicative of our opinion on the long-run potential of each token.The rating scale is as follows:✅ Overweight: We expect this token to outperform ETH.➖ Neutral: We expect this token to perform in-line with ETH.❌ Underweight: We expect this token to underperform ETH.Beginning with this edition, we are also introducing Risk Ratings. These Risk Ratings represent our holistic assessment of the risks associated with each token, including factors such as product traction, valuation, and token liquidity. Each project's risk is measured relative to the other tokens covered in the Token Bible.The risk scale is as follows:🟢 Lower Risk: Lower risk profile relative to others covered here.🟡 Moderate Risk: Average risk profile relative to others covered here.🔴 Higher Risk: Higher risk profile relative to others covered here.✅ OverweightThese are tokens that we believe will outperform ETH.Gains Network (GNS)Author: Jack InabinetType: Coverage InitiationRisk Rating: MediumRating Time Horizon: 6 monthsSector: DeFi - Perpetuals DEXCurrent FDV: $192.1MWe are initiating coverage of GNS with a rating of overweight.Catalyst Overview:GNS coverage is being initiated with a rating of overweight due to the protocol’s successful launch on Arbitrum.Gains Network’s gTrade exchange gives users the ability to take up to 30-150x leverage on a wide variety of alts, bluechips, and stocks, with 1000x leverage on Forex pairs! Previously on Polygon, the Protocol deployed to Arbitrum One on December 31 and TVL has been up only since, increasing 133% to $45M. At the time of analysis, the freshly launched Arbitrum deployment composed 61% of Gains Network’s TVL, with the Protocol’s gDAI vault becoming the largest holder of DAI on Arbitrum.Potential Price Impact:Arbitrum TVL has been on a tear! The success of GMX’s unique GLP fee structure has brought large amounts of stables and bluechip cryptos onto the chain, providing tailwind network effects to other protocols. A growing number of successful projects have brought native adoption to the chain, including TreasureDAO, Radiant, Camelot, and Rage Trade. Continued inflows into the Arbitrum universe will provide a greater amount of available collateral for gTrade. Gains Network is well positioned to continue to attract DeFi native trader attention from competitive products (i.e., GMX), due to increased leverage, a much broader range of tradable tickers, and usage of crypto-native collateral, providing continued support for GNS pricing.Lido (LDO)Author: Ben GioveType: ReiterationRisk Rating: LowRating Time Horizon: 3 monthsSector: Liquid StakingCurrent FDV: $2.3BWe are reiterating our overweight rating on LDO.Catalyst Overview:LDO remains overweight due to the upcoming Shanghai network upgrade.Shanghai is one of the most highly anticipated upgrades in Ethereum’s history, as it will enable withdrawals from staking. As of writing, 14.2% of the ETH supply is staked, with liquid staking protocols accounting for a 33.3% share of deposits. Lido is the largest staker on the Beacon Chain, with a 29.2% share of staked ETH and a 87.7% share within liquid staking.Potential Price Impact:Shanghai should help drive significant revenue growth for Lido, as by fully-derisking staking, the upgrade should lead to a significant inflow into LSDs. While Lido’s market share has trended down since the merge, and will face increasing competitive and social pressure to diversify stake, the massive inflows into liquid staking over the coming months means that the protocol should still benefit from a “rising tide lifts all” boats” environment.Rocket Pool (RPL)Author: Ben GioveType: ReiterationRisk Rating: LowRating Time Horizon: 3 monthsSector: Liquid StakingCurrent FDV: $800.5MWe are reiterating our overweight rating on RPL.Catalyst Overview:RPL remains overweight due to the upcoming Shanghai network upgrade.As discussed above, Shanghai is poised to lead to an influx in deposits for LSD issuers, as withdrawals will fully de-risk staking. Rocket Pool currently has a 2.3% and 6.9% share of total Beacon Chain and liquid staking deposits respectively.Potential Price Impact:Shanghai is set to catalyze inflows into Rocket Pool, and the decentralized protocol should benefit from not only the growth of the sector as a whole but the significant social push to diversify stake. In addition, Rocket Pool is set to benefit from its upcoming Atlas upgrade, which will lower the ETH collateral requirement from minipool operators from 16 to 8. This expected increase in the rETH supply will lead to an increase in demand for RPL, which must be bonded by minipool operators for use as slashing insurance.Canto (CANTO)Author: Ben GioveType: Coverage InitiationRisk Rating: HighRating Time Horizon: 6 monthsSector: L1Current FDV: $555.2MWe are initiating coverage of CANTO with a rating of overweight.Catalyst Overview:CANTO is being assigned this rating due the expectation of continued ecosystem growth.Canto has seen significant liquidity inflows to start 2023, with more than $104M in assets bridged into the network from Ethereum YTD. The L1 has also seen significant growth in other KPIs like active addresses, transactions, and fees. Canto is also seeing an increasing number of participants in the Canto Online Hackathon, with Season 5 of the event having more than 80 registrations compared to 13 in Season 4.Potential Price Impact:The Canto ecosystem looks set to grow over the coming months, as liquidity is flowing into the network and an increasing number of developers are leveraging the network's built-in DeFi primitives. While inflation from liquidity mining emissions could place some downward pressure on the token, an increase in demand for CANTO as the network grows should help offset some of this potential sell-pressure.Treasure DAO (MAGIC)Author: Ben GioveType: Coverage InitiationRisk Rating: MediumRating Time Horizon: 6 monthsSector: GameFiCurrent FDV: $689.8MWe are initiating coverage of MAGIC with a rating of overweight.Catalyst Overview:MAGIC is being assigned this rating due to the expected growth in the Treasure and Arbitrum ecosystems.There are numerous growth catalysts on the horizon within the Treasure ecosystem, such as an increase in adoption of The Beacon, an RPG game, and the launch of MagicSwap V2, an AMM which will support ERC-20 and ERC-721 trades within a single router. Arbitrum, the L2 in which Treasure is based, is also set to experience significant inflows in the coming months upon launch of the Arbitrum token and subsequent incentive programs.Potential Price Impact:The continued growth of games like The Beacon and launch of MagicSwap should drive long-term value to MAGIC, which is used as money within the Treasure ecosystem. Treasure should also benefit from the launch of Arbitrum’s token, of which they are likely to get a considerable allocation through either a direct airdrop or governance. Furthermore, MAGIC should benefit from less uncertainty surrounding unlocks, as a 14.3% supply unlock was completed on January 26.StakeWise (SWISE)Author: Ben GioveType: Coverage InitiationRisk Rating: HighRating Time Horizon: 6 monthsSector: Liquid StakingCurrent FDV: $150.1MWe are initiating coverage of SWISE with a rating of overweight.Catalyst Overview:StakeWise is being assigned this rating due to the Shanghai upgrade and launch of StakeWise V3.Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade will fully de-risk staking by enabling withdrawals, and is set to catalyze a boom in liquid staking as a result. StakeWise is currently the fifth largest liquid staking provider, with 1.3% market share within the sector and accounts for 0.4% of all Beacon Chain deposits. While it currently utilizes a two token model with permissioned validation, in the coming months StakeWise is set to launch V3, which will enable permissionless validation through the use of isolated vaults (similar to Uniswap or Fuse pools).Potential Price Impact:Shanghai and the launch of V3 are poised to lead to significant growth in StakeWise’s market share and revenues, with the decentralization and customizability of the protocol likely to attract both stakers and validators alike. In addition, the value created by V3 should more easily accrue to tokenholders, as a proposed tokenomics upgrade supported by the core team will allow SWISE holders to earn a share commissions from an individual vault in exchange for staking their tokens as slashing insurance.New Order DAO (NEWO)Author: Ben GioveType: Coverage InitiationRisk Rating: HighRating Time Horizon: 6 monthsSector: Venture DAOCurrent FDV: $25.0MWe are initiating coverage of NEWO with a rating of overweight.Catalyst Overview:New Order DAO is being assigned this rating due to the growth of [Redacted] Cartel and Y2K Finance.New Order’s two largest incubated projects are [Redacted] Cartel, a DeFi conglomerate, and Y2K Finance, a protocol for hedging/speculating on risk in pegged assets, with the two trading at FDVs of $198M and $41M respectively. New Order owns 5% of the BTRFLY supply and 10% of the Y2K supply, with its combined stakes being worth ~$14.0M at current prices.Potential Price Impact:The continued growth of Redacted and Y2K should help lead to long-term value accrual for the DAO treasury and veNEWO lockers, who in the future will earn 20% of yield generated from all treasury assets including these positions. This success of these two high profile incubees should also help increase the ability for New Order to attract and incubate high quality projects in the future. In addition, NEWO should also benefit from a narrowing of discount to RFV, as with a MC of $5.9M, the token is trading a 2.4x discount to the value of these positions alone.➖ NeutralThese are tokens that we believe will perform in-line with ETH.dYdX (DYDX)Author: Jack InabinetType: UpgradeRisk Rating: MediumRatings Time Horizon: 3 MonthsSector: DeFi - Perpetuals DEXCurrent FDV: $3.6BWe are upgrading DYDX from underweight to neutral.Catalyst Overview:DYDX is being upgraded due to the postponement of impending token unlocks.After announcing 150M of DYDX unlocks scheduled for February would be postponed until December 2023, with 30% of the original 150M DYDX tokens set to unlock on December 1 and the remaining via monthly unlocks thereafter, a major potential supply pressure was removed from the DYDX pricing equation.

By tapping into 100% of protocol revenue, Gray hoped to enable continuous operation for the foreseeable future. Prior to this change, 90% of revenue went to xSUSHI stakers, with 10% remitted to the treasury.Currently, the SushiSwap team incurs $5M in annual expenditures.Potential Price Impact:Deprecation of the Kanpai fee share removed a positive influence on SUSHI price. While it is possible to argue that by doing so, SushiSwap bolstered its longevity and the move can be viewed as a net positive, we believe that this action attests to ongoing struggles faced by the Protocol.SushiSwap is gasping for its last breath of air, not engaging in shrewd governance. In a market saturated with more established names and upstart DEXs alike, SushiSwap is simply losing its edge. While Gray sees up to 1.5 years of runway, volatile crypto market conditions could truncate this projection. Currently, nearly 90% of the SushiSwap treasury is composed of non-stable assets, with 84% represented by native SUSHI and xSUSHI tokens. Continued struggles at SushiSwap would not bode well for the value of SUSHI or the runway.

In addition, NEWO should also benefit from a narrowing of discount to RFV, as with a MC of $5.9M, the token is trading a 2.4x discount to the value of these positions alone.➖ NeutralThese are tokens that we believe will perform in-line with ETH.dYdX (DYDX)Author: Jack InabinetType: UpgradeRisk Rating: MediumRatings Time Horizon: 3 MonthsSector: DeFi - Perpetuals DEXCurrent FDV: $3.6BWe are upgrading DYDX from underweight to neutral.Catalyst Overview:DYDX is being upgraded due to the postponement of impending token unlocks.After announcing 150M of DYDX unlocks scheduled for February would be postponed until December 2023, with 30% of the original 150M DYDX tokens set to unlock on December 1 and the remaining via monthly unlocks thereafter, a major potential supply pressure was removed from the DYDX pricing equation. Currently, the circulating supply of DYDX is 148M: scheduled unlocks would have doubled this! The driving factor for Bankless’s underweight rating was impending unlocks, now a near-term non-factor.Potential Price Impact:Note the 3 month rating timeline, anon!While the price of DYDX will likely appreciate in the near-term, the team is employing emergency stopgap measures to protect token price, currently down 88% from its ATH. dYdX V4 is set to launch as a stand-alone Cosmos-based chain. If the team intends to use DYDX as the fee token of its chain, it is crucial to inflate token PRICE as much as possible to avoid inflating token SUPPLY to secure the network; postponement of unlocks shows that this may be their intent. DYDX continues to face longer-term structural headwinds from looming unlocks and potential token inflation to secure the dYdX chain. The can has simply been kicked down the road, not removed from the equation!❌ UnderweightThese are tokens that we believe will underperform ETH over the next six months.SushiSwap (SUSHI)Author: Jack InabinetType: ReiterationRelative Risk Rating: HighRatings Time Horizon: 6 MonthsSector: DeFi - Spot DEXCurrent FDV: $349.3MWe are reiterating our underweight rating on SUSHI.Catalyst Overview:SUSHI continues to face strong headwinds after the Protocol voted to divert 100% of protocol fee revenue to the treasury.SushiSwap Head Chef Jared Gray noted in December that failures to diversify the community treasury, despite best efforts to cut costs, left the project with approximately 1.5 years of runway for operations. By tapping into 100% of protocol revenue, Gray hoped to enable continuous operation for the foreseeable future. Prior to this change, 90% of revenue went to xSUSHI stakers, with 10% remitted to the treasury.Currently, the SushiSwap team incurs $5M in annual expenditures.Potential Price Impact:Deprecation of the Kanpai fee share removed a positive influence on SUSHI price. While it is possible to argue that by doing so, SushiSwap bolstered its longevity and the move can be viewed as a net positive, we believe that this action attests to ongoing struggles faced by the Protocol.SushiSwap is gasping for its last breath of air, not engaging in shrewd governance. In a market saturated with more established names and upstart DEXs alike, SushiSwap is simply losing its edge. While Gray sees up to 1.5 years of runway, volatile crypto market conditions could truncate this projection. Currently, nearly 90% of the SushiSwap treasury is composed of non-stable assets, with 84% represented by native SUSHI and xSUSHI tokens. Continued struggles at SushiSwap would not bode well for the value of SUSHI or the runway. SUSHI may be on its last legs.🏦 Introducing Bankless FundThe Token Ratings and Token Bible are getting an upgrade.We are excited to announce that we are integrating Bankless Fund, a private investment club made up of Bankless team members, into the Token Bible!The Bankless Fund is how we put our own skin in the game with our Token Ratings, as it takes long positions in what we feel are our highest conviction, highest upside (and therefore highest risk) overweights.Bankless Premium subscribers will get an exclusive peek behind the curtain, as we will be publishing our thesis behind each Bankless Fund investment in the Token Bible.NOTE: YOU CANNOT INVEST IN THE BANKLESS FUND.

It also updates coverage on DYDX while reiterating coverage on LDO, RPL, and SUSHI.Below, we’ll discuss the rationale behind each rating by delving into the driving catalysts and their potential impact on the token’s price.We are also providing a comprehensive overview of many of the tokens we cover via the Bankless Token Bible!📓 Token Bible access at the bottom of this report. Bankless Premium only! Bankless Fund positions and their respective investment theses are also included in the Token Bible (more on this later).The Token Bible is an investor’s “cheat-sheet” as it’s a one-stop-shop where you can get access to all of the ratings and historical notes for each token covered by the analyst team.Explaining Our Rating Scales and Risk ScalesBefore we dive into the coverage and ratings, let’s take a moment to explain our rating scale. The ratings reflect how we expect each token will perform over a specified (3 or 6 month) time horizon relative to the performance of ETH. It is not indicative of our opinion on the long-run potential of each token.The rating scale is as follows:✅ Overweight: We expect this token to outperform ETH.➖ Neutral: We expect this token to perform in-line with ETH.❌ Underweight: We expect this token to underperform ETH.Beginning with this edition, we are also introducing Risk Ratings. These Risk Ratings represent our holistic assessment of the risks associated with each token, including factors such as product traction, valuation, and token liquidity. Each project's risk is measured relative to the other tokens covered in the Token Bible.The risk scale is as follows:🟢 Lower Risk: Lower risk profile relative to others covered here.🟡 Moderate Risk: Average risk profile relative to others covered here.🔴 Higher Risk: Higher risk profile relative to others covered here.✅ OverweightThese are tokens that we believe will outperform ETH.Gains Network (GNS)Author: Jack InabinetType: Coverage InitiationRisk Rating: MediumRating Time Horizon: 6 monthsSector: DeFi - Perpetuals DEXCurrent FDV: $192.1MWe are initiating coverage of GNS with a rating of overweight.Catalyst Overview:GNS coverage is being initiated with a rating of overweight due to the protocol’s successful launch on Arbitrum.Gains Network’s gTrade exchange gives users the ability to take up to 30-150x leverage on a wide variety of alts, bluechips, and stocks, with 1000x leverage on Forex pairs! Previously on Polygon, the Protocol deployed to Arbitrum One on December 31 and TVL has been up only since, increasing 133% to $45M. At the time of analysis, the freshly launched Arbitrum deployment composed 61% of Gains Network’s TVL, with the Protocol’s gDAI vault becoming the largest holder of DAI on Arbitrum.Potential Price Impact:Arbitrum TVL has been on a tear! The success of GMX’s unique GLP fee structure has brought large amounts of stables and bluechip cryptos onto the chain, providing tailwind network effects to other protocols. A growing number of successful projects have brought native adoption to the chain, including TreasureDAO, Radiant, Camelot, and Rage Trade. Continued inflows into the Arbitrum universe will provide a greater amount of available collateral for gTrade. Gains Network is well positioned to continue to attract DeFi native trader attention from competitive products (i.e., GMX), due to increased leverage, a much broader range of tradable tickers, and usage of crypto-native collateral, providing continued support for GNS pricing.Lido (LDO)Author: Ben GioveType: ReiterationRisk Rating: LowRating Time Horizon: 3 monthsSector: Liquid StakingCurrent FDV: $2.3BWe are reiterating our overweight rating on LDO.Catalyst Overview:LDO remains overweight due to the upcoming Shanghai network upgrade.Shanghai is one of the most highly anticipated upgrades in Ethereum’s history, as it will enable withdrawals from staking. As of writing, 14.2% of the ETH supply is staked, with liquid staking protocols accounting for a 33.3% share of deposits. Lido is the largest staker on the Beacon Chain, with a 29.2% share of staked ETH and a 87.7% share within liquid staking.Potential Price Impact:Shanghai should help drive significant revenue growth for Lido, as by fully-derisking staking, the upgrade should lead to a significant inflow into LSDs. While Lido’s market share has trended down since the merge, and will face increasing competitive and social pressure to diversify stake, the massive inflows into liquid staking over the coming months means that the protocol should still benefit from a “rising tide lifts all” boats” environment.Rocket Pool (RPL)Author: Ben GioveType: ReiterationRisk Rating: LowRating Time Horizon: 3 monthsSector: Liquid StakingCurrent FDV: $800.5MWe are reiterating our overweight rating on RPL.Catalyst Overview:RPL remains overweight due to the upcoming Shanghai network upgrade.As discussed above, Shanghai is poised to lead to an influx in deposits for LSD issuers, as withdrawals will fully de-risk staking. Rocket Pool currently has a 2.3% and 6.9% share of total Beacon Chain and liquid staking deposits respectively.Potential Price Impact:Shanghai is set to catalyze inflows into Rocket Pool, and the decentralized protocol should benefit from not only the growth of the sector as a whole but the significant social push to diversify stake. In addition, Rocket Pool is set to benefit from its upcoming Atlas upgrade, which will lower the ETH collateral requirement from minipool operators from 16 to 8. This expected increase in the rETH supply will lead to an increase in demand for RPL, which must be bonded by minipool operators for use as slashing insurance.Canto (CANTO)Author: Ben GioveType: Coverage InitiationRisk Rating: HighRating Time Horizon: 6 monthsSector: L1Current FDV: $555.2MWe are initiating coverage of CANTO with a rating of overweight.Catalyst Overview:CANTO is being assigned this rating due the expectation of continued ecosystem growth.Canto has seen significant liquidity inflows to start 2023, with more than $104M in assets bridged into the network from Ethereum YTD. The L1 has also seen significant growth in other KPIs like active addresses, transactions, and fees. Canto is also seeing an increasing number of participants in the Canto Online Hackathon, with Season 5 of the event having more than 80 registrations compared to 13 in Season 4.Potential Price Impact:The Canto ecosystem looks set to grow over the coming months, as liquidity is flowing into the network and an increasing number of developers are leveraging the network's built-in DeFi primitives. While inflation from liquidity mining emissions could place some downward pressure on the token, an increase in demand for CANTO as the network grows should help offset some of this potential sell-pressure.Treasure DAO (MAGIC)Author: Ben GioveType: Coverage InitiationRisk Rating: MediumRating Time Horizon: 6 monthsSector: GameFiCurrent FDV: $689.8MWe are initiating coverage of MAGIC with a rating of overweight.Catalyst Overview:MAGIC is being assigned this rating due to the expected growth in the Treasure and Arbitrum ecosystems.There are numerous growth catalysts on the horizon within the Treasure ecosystem, such as an increase in adoption of The Beacon, an RPG game, and the launch of MagicSwap V2, an AMM which will support ERC-20 and ERC-721 trades within a single router. Arbitrum, the L2 in which Treasure is based, is also set to experience significant inflows in the coming months upon launch of the Arbitrum token and subsequent incentive programs.Potential Price Impact:The continued growth of games like The Beacon and launch of MagicSwap should drive long-term value to MAGIC, which is used as money within the Treasure ecosystem. Treasure should also benefit from the launch of Arbitrum’s token, of which they are likely to get a considerable allocation through either a direct airdrop or governance. Furthermore, MAGIC should benefit from less uncertainty surrounding unlocks, as a 14.3% supply unlock was completed on January 26.StakeWise (SWISE)Author: Ben GioveType: Coverage InitiationRisk Rating: HighRating Time Horizon: 6 monthsSector: Liquid StakingCurrent FDV: $150.1MWe are initiating coverage of SWISE with a rating of overweight.Catalyst Overview:StakeWise is being assigned this rating due to the Shanghai upgrade and launch of StakeWise V3.Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade will fully de-risk staking by enabling withdrawals, and is set to catalyze a boom in liquid staking as a result. StakeWise is currently the fifth largest liquid staking provider, with 1.3% market share within the sector and accounts for 0.4% of all Beacon Chain deposits. While it currently utilizes a two token model with permissioned validation, in the coming months StakeWise is set to launch V3, which will enable permissionless validation through the use of isolated vaults (similar to Uniswap or Fuse pools).Potential Price Impact:Shanghai and the launch of V3 are poised to lead to significant growth in StakeWise’s market share and revenues, with the decentralization and customizability of the protocol likely to attract both stakers and validators alike. In addition, the value created by V3 should more easily accrue to tokenholders, as a proposed tokenomics upgrade supported by the core team will allow SWISE holders to earn a share commissions from an individual vault in exchange for staking their tokens as slashing insurance.New Order DAO (NEWO)Author: Ben GioveType: Coverage InitiationRisk Rating: HighRating Time Horizon: 6 monthsSector: Venture DAOCurrent FDV: $25.0MWe are initiating coverage of NEWO with a rating of overweight.Catalyst Overview:New Order DAO is being assigned this rating due to the growth of [Redacted] Cartel and Y2K Finance.New Order’s two largest incubated projects are [Redacted] Cartel, a DeFi conglomerate, and Y2K Finance, a protocol for hedging/speculating on risk in pegged assets, with the two trading at FDVs of $198M and $41M respectively. New Order owns 5% of the BTRFLY supply and 10% of the Y2K supply, with its combined stakes being worth ~$14.0M at current prices.Potential Price Impact:The continued growth of Redacted and Y2K should help lead to long-term value accrual for the DAO treasury and veNEWO lockers, who in the future will earn 20% of yield generated from all treasury assets including these positions. This success of these two high profile incubees should also help increase the ability for New Order to attract and incubate high quality projects in the future. In addition, NEWO should also benefit from a narrowing of discount to RFV, as with a MC of $5.9M, the token is trading a 2.4x discount to the value of these positions alone.➖ NeutralThese are tokens that we believe will perform in-line with ETH.dYdX (DYDX)Author: Jack InabinetType: UpgradeRisk Rating: MediumRatings Time Horizon: 3 MonthsSector: DeFi - Perpetuals DEXCurrent FDV: $3.6BWe are upgrading DYDX from underweight to neutral.Catalyst Overview:DYDX is being upgraded due to the postponement of impending token unlocks.After announcing 150M of DYDX unlocks scheduled for February would be postponed until December 2023, with 30% of the original 150M DYDX tokens set to unlock on December 1 and the remaining via monthly unlocks thereafter, a major potential supply pressure was removed from the DYDX pricing equation.

This Bankless tactic curates five under-the-radar opps that are compelling and straightforward for NFTfi newcomers.Goal: Dive deeper into NFTfiSkill: IntermediateEffort: 1 hourROI: Double-digit % APRs on some apps5 ways to ride the rise of NFTfiRight now, the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi is ~$49B, and the market cap of the NFT space is over $15B.This means DeFi and the NFT ecosystem are handily the largest sectors in the cryptoeconomy today. However, these sectors are increasingly intersecting and blurring, giving rise to the category “NFTfi” — i.e., projects providing services at the crossroads of DeFi and NFTs.Of course, NFTs are unique digital assets that represent ownership of a specific piece of content, while DeFi is all about creating decentralized and open financial products. When you combine the two, you get a brave new world of bleeding-edge financial opportunities for NFT holders.These opps come in a range of different forms, from collateralizing NFTs for loans to yield farming with idle NFTs on liquidity protocols. Some of the more recognizable NFTfi categories and projects that are creating these sorts of opps today include:⛲ NFT automated market makers (AMMs) — NFTX, NFT20, sudoswap🪙 Borrowing and lending protocols — Arcade, BendDAO, NFTfi🏦 Derivatives protocols — Hook, nftperp, Solv🧮 Pricing projects — Abacus, UpshotBut let’s say you’re a newcomer to NFTfi and you find this all very interesting but you’re not sure where to start. In this case, you’ll want to begin with straightforward opps that are relatively simple to use and don’t require having to track a bunch of information on an ongoing basis.I watch the NFTfi scene closely in the course of my research at Metaversal, so I’ve been curating a list of these sorts of simpler opps lately. Today I’ve got a handful of cool ones to share with you.Of course, treat these as early experiments as most are quite new. If you do try any, never deposit more crypto or NFTs than you can afford to lose. With a “safety first” approach, here are 5 fresh and under-the-radar opps you might consider as potential starting points for your first forays into NFTfi.1) Caviar LPing🧙‍♂️ Product Update 🧙‍♂️

Now Liquidity Providers can check their position Profit/Loss using the 'Your NFTs' Page! pic.twitter.com/Qe3JReU4qO— Caviar (@caviarAMM) February 20, 2023

LinksApp | Docs | Twitter | Discord | Audit📜 101Caviar is an NFT AMM protocol for trading NFTs. It supports NFT fractionalization via ERC20s and also offers a unique ""desirability classifier"" system to organize NFT collections into sub-pools according to desirability scores. As such, each Caviar master pool has multiple independent price curves to account for an entire NFT collection's liquidity. With this sub-pool system, the protocol aims to increase liquidity for rarer NFTs and incentivize trading activity for liquidity providers (LPs).🎯 The oppLPs on Caviar earn yield from a 1% fee that’s charged on every Caviar NFT swap. As more people trade through a given pool, that pool’s LPs earn more yield accordingly. The strat here, then, is LPing with ETH and NFTs in an active Caviar pool to profit from trading activity over time. For example, as you can see in the screenshot below, Cool Cats LPs on Caviar are currently earning 58% APR as based on the past 30 days of trading activity.2) PaprWe're excited to share that paprMEME, the first instance of the papr protocol, is now live!

🦄 LP on Uniswap to earn fees from volatility pic.twitter.com/OHoIz9NvRj— Backed 🖼🐇 (@backed_xyz) February 10, 2023

LinksApp | Docs | Twitter | Discord | Audit📜 101Created by Backed and inspired by Squeeth, Papr is a new type of NFT lending protocol that is designed to be flexible, resilient, and usable without lockup periods. This new approach centers around papr (“Perpetual APR”) tokens, which are mintable by borrowers upon sending NFTs as collateral to a papr controller smart contract. Borrowers can then sell these tokens on a DEX like Uniswap as needed, and this market activity creates a constant feedback loop between the papr trading price and the protocol’s interest rates.🎯 The oppA papr token offers holders and LPs a low-maintenance, “buy and hold” way to get exposure to multiple NFT collections and loans at once, as it offers the potential for interest in the form of its feedback-based price appreciation system. For instance, the first such token, $paprMEME, offers exposure to loans across 10 collections including Cool Cats, Forgotten Runes Wizard’s Cult, and Mfers.3) insrt finance ShardVaultsWe've locked in ~300 $ETH in TVL since the launch of our MVP, the ShardVault and we don't plan on stopping 👑💎

Like & RT to secure your slot(s) in the vault 🔑 pic.twitter.com/p6T2tPrbOF— insrt finance (@insrtfinance) February 23, 2023

LinksApp | Docs | Twitter | Discord | Audit📜 101insrt finance is an NFT protocol for set-and-forget yield strategies, and its first category of product is called ShardVaults. Described as “fractional NFT spot exposure combined with passive yield farming,” these vaults offer low-priced ownership of bluechip NFTs via Shards, which are NFTs that represent fractional ownership of a ShardVault’s base NFT, e.g. a Bored Ape. Then the base NFT itself is put to work in NFTfi, generating yield for that NFT’s constituent Shard holders. For instance, insrt's first ShardVaults (for CryptoPunk #9620 and BAYC #1369) are both generating their Shard holders over 15% APR right now.🎯 The oppShardVaults #1, #2, and #3 have been fully minted out already, so until more vaults are rolled out the only way to get exposure to these initial NFT-based yield opps is to acquire Shards on a secondary marketplace like OpenSea. If you do, then you’ll automatically start raking in passive yield from the underlying NFT’s deployment.4) MetaStreet Capital Vaults1/ We are excited to announce today the Alpha launch of the MetaStreet Collateral Vault, the first liquidity scaling solution for NFT credit markets. Our first Vault launches in 2 hours at https://t.co/vfJGXrOX2r pic.twitter.com/s2N2FvCl3E— MetaStreet (@metastreetxyz) May 31, 2022

LinksApp | Docs | Twitter | Discord | Audit📜 101MetaStreet is a decentralized interest rate protocol for the metaverse. Its initial flagship products are its Capital Vaults, which let people deposit ETH, DAI, and later other crypto to earn from NFT-based vault strategies. Specifically, the Capital Vaults use these deposited funds to acquire P2P NFT-based promissory notes facilitated via lending projects like nftfi.com, and these notes provide yield via interest payments and liquidations. In this sense, you can think of MetaStreet’s Capital Vaults as an aggregator of NFT lending side liquidity.🎯 The oppHere, the idea is depositing into one of MetaStreet’s Capital Vaults for passive earnings. Since depositors can choose how much of their funds are split between senior (higher-risk) and junior (lower-risk) vault positions, how much APR you earn depends on how you blend your exposure. For instance, a 30/70 senior/junior split through the General-WETH Vault would generate ~20% APR at the moment.5) Hook EarnLinksApp | Docs | Twitter | Discord | Audit📜 101Hook is a decentralized NFT derivatives protocol that specializes in European-style call options, which allow people to speculate on the price of an NFT during a specific timeframe without having to fork over the full asking price for said NFT. To go deeper on the basic nuances here, check out this guide I wrote on Hook last year. In simple terms, though, Hook lets NFT holders earn premiums on their NFTs or sell them at optimal prices while offering traders the opportunity to earn from speculative longs or shorts.🎯 The oppHook’s latest product is Hook Earn, which is powered by the protocol’s call options under the hood. This new service allows NFT owners to start getting instant earnings on their idle NFTs so long as they agree to list said NFTs for a particular price at a particular future date. If there’s no purchase on that target date, you get to keep the NFT and can redeposit it into the Earn system. If an NFT sells for higher than its listing price (which is always above a collection’s floor price), then the trader involved earns the spread.

Things aren’t looking great with a mass exodus of depositors and the bank staring down the barrel of insolvency. A TradFi blowup ought to push regulators to establish clearer guidelines and protections for good faith actors aiming to innovate, but in all likelihood the federal government will just use this as another excuse to put up roadblocks for institutional players that embrace crypto. - Bankless team If you've ever onramped into crypto through a centralized exchange, you have likely indirectly used Silvergate bank. Silvergate is the biggest crypto-friendly bank, with 90%+ of its deposits from the crypto sector. The bank pivoted from a small regional presence in the past decade into a major bank with $12B in deposits by Q3 2022, servicing major crypto institutions like Coinbase, Gemini, FTX and BlockFi. After months of turmoil, Silvergate is seemingly capitulating under a mix of regulatory and market pressure this past week — undergoing something of a bank run. The straw that broke the camel’s back was Silvergate’s two-week delay of its annual 10-K SEC filing last Thursday, citing the need for more time to assess its finances. Silvergate’s stock immediately spiraled on the news, dropping 55% to around $6.50 per share. JPMorgan analysts downgraded Silvergate’s already-beaten down stock from “neutral” to “underweight” rating. In response, Silvergate’s clients began severing ties with the bank’s services. Coinbase quickly distanced itself when it announced a switch to Silvergate’s main competitor Signature, another crypto-friendly bank. At Coinbase all client funds continue to be safe, accessible & available. In light of recent developments & out of an abundance of caution, Coinbase is no longer accepting or initiating payments to or from Silvergate. — Coinbase (@coinbase) March 2, 2023 Other clients that have left Silvergate for greener pastures include Paxos, Crypto.com, Bitstamp, Cboe Digital Markets, Galaxy Digital, Gemini and LedgerX. On Friday, Silvergate was forced to suspend its Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN), its zero-interest payment platform that crypto companies use to make fiat transactions with one another. Silvergate’s insolvency concerns have been brewing for months. When crypto suffered a credit crisis in 2022, Silvergate saw an $8B drawdown. To maintain a liquid balance sheet, the bank was forced to off $5.2B worth of bonds in its portfolio amid a high interest rate environment where the Fed was hiking rates to stave off inflation, incurring losses of $751.4M. Silvergate also borrowed a whopping $4.3B in short-term loans from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) system, a government-backed shadow bank that supports domestic commercial banks in poor market conditions by borrowing from institutional investors at generally below market interest rates and lending to member banks. Silvergate survived the FTX collapse but it did not come out unscathed. The bank reported a ~$1B loss for Q4 2022 and was forced to cut its staff by 40% (200 employees). Unfortunately, the bank’s close association with FTX attracted the attention of regulatory hawks, increasing reputational risk and investor uncertainty. U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren, John Kennedy and Roger Marshall began probing Silvergate on December 6 for its role in facilitating fraudulent transfers between FTX and Alameda, alleging an “egregious failure of Silvergate’s responsibility to monitor for and report suspicious financial activity carried out by its clients”. Silvergate’s press release then claimed that total deposits from FTX were less than 10% of all its $11.9B deposits. On February 2, U.S. prosecutors in the DoJ were reportedly investigating Silvergate’s for its relationship with FTX and Alameda. In short, Silvergate is buckling under the combination of a massive capital withdrawal plus unwanted regulatory scrutiny. Bad liabilities, not bad assets, are the root of the problem. Unlike Three Arrows Capital or FTX, the ongoing bank run on Silvergate is not due to the implosion of risky overleveraged loans against volatile crypto collateral. As Bloomberg’s Matt Levine writes on Money Stuff: The story today is that Silvergate’s customers are withdrawing their money because they are worried about Silvergate, “in light of recent developments & out of an abundance of caution,” classic bank-run stuff. But that's not why they were withdrawing their money in late 2022, when the trouble started. Then, they were withdrawing their money because crypto had collapsed: Silvergate’s crypto-exchange customers faced withdrawals from their customers, so they took their money out of Silvergate. The customers — crypto exchanges — were the problem, not Silvergate. Ultimately, the knock-on effects of FTX contagion is starting to catch up with Silvergate. As the main channel for market makers in crypto to move capital quickly, Silvergate’s demise does not bode well for the industry. The Silvergate panic led to a total crypto market cap dip of 4.8% during ETH Denver week. This fiasco also poses an important existential question for crypto: how can crypto survive without relying on centralized, TradFi rails? The easy answer is “just don’t use TradFi”. But that is perhaps too naive in the short-term, and the reality is there will be some dependency on financially regulated institutions to facilitate capital flows in and out of the sector. If so, crypto must avoid putting all its eggs in one basket and not build into a centralized pothole as it seems to have done with Silvergate. As it stands, the small handful of crypto banks — in particular Silvergate and Signature — represent convenient chokepoints and easy targets for anti-crypto regulators to undermine the industry. Diversification of crypto banks is key, but unfriendly actions and a general lack of support from financial regulators have made it extremely difficult for banks to embrace new financial technologies and serve crypto clients. This has hamstrung the sector and may leave America’s dinosaur financial institutions less willing to take risks to innovate.","Dear Bankless Nation,After a couple of months of crypto peace and prosperity, there’s trouble brewing with a good old-fashioned bank run facing crypto-friendly Silvergate.

ETH Denver has grown a ton. In 2018, it was a 5k-person event, with plastic folding table “booths” with branded tablecloths. Around 95% of the projects attending and sponsoring the 2018 ETH Denver event are gone, and the remaining 5% are now the core infrastructure of our industry, and their associated builders are insanely wealthy (and deservedly so!)$ETH was ~$700 at ETH Denver 2018, up about 100x in a year. A year later, $ETH was $100, down 95% from its ATH.Nonetheless, ETH Denver 2019 was a 2x in excitement, optimism, and signal. And so on, and so forth. Every single year, ETH Denver grows in size and strength, regardless of market conditions.In the span of 5 short years, ETH Denver has grown from a 5k-person, 3-day hackathon, to a multi-week 16k-person conference, with 4k more coming for just the side-events.It’s the largest and longest-running Ethereum conference, and its simply the best fucking time of the year.I’ll stop gushing, and let’s get into the content. Like always, I go to conferences so you don’t have to! (even though you should!). For this conference, I brought my team in tow, and we were able to record over 20 interviews, spanning three hours of content. Some of it is already released; the rest will be out 🔜™.Read on, and you’ll feel like you didn’t miss a thing!✨The ETH Denver Video Series✨@TrustlessState goes to conferences so you don't have to!

Side EventsETH Denver has become so large, it has overflowed into an additional series of side events that were themselves larger than most conferences. It was impossible to experience all of ETH Denver; it was too large! ETH Denver was very much a choose-your-own-adventure, so below I’ll walk you through the adventure I found for myself.For those who prioritize different things than I did, ETH Denver had plenty else to offer. Aptos, Sui, Cosmos, Holochain, DAODenver, Filecoin, Mina Protocol and Polkadot all had their respective events, and what I just listed were a fraction of everything that went down.Monday and Tuesday - Axelar Interoperability SummitThe Interop Summit was a who’s who of chains, bridges, and abstraction infrastructure. I’ve recorded eight interviews with folks like Steven Goldfeder from Arbitrum, Sreeram from EigenLayer, Jordi from Polygon, and Ledger from UpOnly / Flip.xyz!The focus of the Interop Summit was interesting. It was hosted by Axelar, a newer L1 that I’ve known about for a while, but hadn’t yet passed my (very high) bar for investigation. The Summit was all about connecting the worlds of Cosmos, all Ethereum L2s and L3s, and all the other chains too. Simply put, the subject matter was everything but the Ethereum L1 (and Bitcoin).Check out the Bankless interviews from the Interop Summit!What bear market? #InteropSummit pic.twitter.com/gF016xj6mu— CosmosHOSS.eth (@CosmosHOSS) February 27, 2023

Tuesday - ZK DayZK Day was an entire day-long event centered around Zero-Knowledge tech. At ETH Denver 2018, there were maybe 3 talks about ZK tech. In 2023, there was an entire day-long event solely dedicated to it, one that was about as big as ETH Denver 2018 was as a whole.Nerds rise! 🚀Tell me everyone is ZK bullish without telling me they’re bullish.

Interestingly, this event was dominated by representatives from Asia. I had never seen such a concentration of projects, teams, and community members from China, Japan, and Korea.Also Tuesday - PoolyConA stones-throw away from ZK Day was PoolyCon. PoolyCon a day of celebration for the PoolTogether and Pooly NFT community, which attracted some of the deepest crypto OGs that Leighton and I have come to know ever since our mutual time in Ethereum.Stumbled upon Poolycon at @EthereumDenver by chance and… I’m absolutely amazed by @PoolTogether_ ‘s team and community pic.twitter.com/AiovMcpuYQ— 🔥 vanzoo (@vanzooeth) February 28, 2023

The Pooly movement has become the spearhead of defending DeFi against external attack after PoolTogether received a class-action lawsuit after someone claimed they “lost money” by paying the gas fee needed to use PoolTogether.Wednesday - WalletConWallets! They store your crypto. But really, they’re so much more. The long-term role that wallets will play in this world is that they represent you. Eventually, the lines between you and your wallet will blur.WalletCon was a one-day event focused on that future state, and what all we need to do to get there.#WalletCon2023 is happening now. 💥 #ETHDenver pic.twitter.com/Q0mxpgyslj— WalletCon (@WalletCon_) March 1, 2023

WalletCon probably had the best website of all the ETH Denver side events. Wallets are a big subject of course, and the programming of WalletCon didn’t hold back. Identity, messaging, cross-chain UX, and account abstraction were all huge topics here, and WalletCon hosted one of the biggest announcements of the week: ERC4337 deployed to the Ethereum L1.Smart Contract Wallets can now be built on the Ethereum L1!The rumors are true...

I asked about what crypto elements are found in the game, and the founder said there is a Diablo or Borderlands-styled loot system, in which every item dropped in-game is an NFT, along with an in-game ERC20 currency.I had no idea we were this far along.𝔸𝕃ℙℍ𝔸 𝔻𝔼𝕄𝕆

Conferences - A ConclusionI’ve never been to a conference in any other industry outside of crypto, so I can’t really speak to those experiences. But, I’ll claim without counter-evidence that there’s really nothing like a crypto-conference.The combination of community, culture, knowledge sharing and investment alpha can’t be found anywhere else in this world.I personally notice myself becoming ‘spiritually alive’ during conference weeks, and the afterglow lasts for weeks afterward.  Conferences are when the magical optimism and enthusiasm that people have for crypto erupts IRL, in a grand festival of all the things that make crypto fun and make life good.My only hope is that this culture and feeling can be scaled out globally to the entire world, as soon as we can learn to scale our protocols to get there.",https://www.bankless.com/eth-denver-2023-was-everything,2023-03-09T00:00:00.000Z,https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/2023/03/image-3.png,David Hoffman,Bankless,blog,Unknown Error,
f102bc66f5b45c32e31aba070973138d6de9e642f4f0fe1b65262f4882d1df7f,How a Few Banks Lost Everything All at Once,A complete rundown on the market chaos and what it means for the future of your bags.,,"Bailouts-on-Demand Sunday evening, the feds showed their cards. Joint action from the Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and the FDIC laid out a path towards resolution. Regulators hope this will stymie additional bank runs. In a statement, regulators confirm that all depositors, both insured and uninsured, of SVB and Signature will have full access to deposits as of Monday morning, with no losses of the resolution being borne by taxpayers. Any shortfalls from asset sales to cover uninsured depositor claims will instead be “recovered by a special assessment on banks, as required by law.” Signature Bank was revealed to have been taken over by regulators in the announcement, with a similar program announced for their insured and uninsured depositors, marking the third bank to fail this week and the third largest ever in the United States. Simultaneously came a new Fed program, called the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP). How does this new alphabet soup lending program work? The BTFP will offer term loans to banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other eligible depository institutions on US Treasuries, agency debt and MBS, and whatever “other qualifying assets” means as collateral. The kicker? The Fed is lending out on these securities at par! Forget about all those unrealized losses on HTM securities banks have accrued: the Fed is stepping in and lending not on the market value of these instruments, but on the future promised repayment . Essentially, Jerome Powell is offering undercollateralized loans to banking institutions. Across the pond in Great Britain and absent the powers imbued by the American money printer, the UK’s Finance Minister scrambled to piece together a deal to protect the nation’s startup industry, disrupted by the collapse of SVB UK. Thankfully, HSBC’s UK division announced a purchase of the bank, for a meager £1.","Dear Bankless Nation,These last few days were a doozy – as bank runs played out in real time on Twitter and startup-land waited on bated breath for the government to come save their asses.Today, we dig into what went wrong, and where we are now. Today's newsletter is a long one, but we've got some Market Monday goodies at the bottom to reward you.- Bankless teamFour months after the fraud-induced collapse of FTX, crypto and tech-centric banks in California are crossing the River Styx on their one-way journey into the depths of Hades.Anyone else want to roll back the clock to a time when the biggest fear was an alien invasion?Today, we’re (trying) to touch on everything that is breaking over in the trad financial system🤮 – and how that is impacting the crypto markets. Bankless has got you covered with a rundown to help you navigate this difficult market and start your week off in-the-know.A Humble 'Crypto Bank'Our story begins in La Jolla, California, the former home of crypto’s once preeminent, but now defunct, banking institution: Silvergate.After the collapse of FTX, depositors ran on the bank, with more than $8B withdrawn in Q4 2022 forcing Silvergate to realize a loss of $1B in the quarter from selling securities that declined in value as rates rose aggressively throughout 2022.In an effort to preserve solvency, Silvergate cut its workforce by 40%. CEO Alan Lane vowed to “return [Silvergate] to profitability in the second half of 2023” and committed to maintaining a “highly liquid balance sheet with minimal credit exposure and a strong capital position” in January’s investor call, in a futile attempt to diffuse investor and depositor fears alike.Liquidity came in the form of $4.3B in loan advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, a government-backed wholesale funding program available to banking institutions. Unfortunately for Lane and Silvergate, unexpected security sales to repay these advances forced the bank to record additional losses in 2023, negatively impacting capital ratios and pushing the bank into “less than well-capitalized” territory.On March 8, Silvergate made the difficult, yet responsible, decision to “wind down operations and voluntarily liquidate the Bank in an orderly manner and in accordance with applicable regulatory processes.”My faith in (crypto’s) humanity is restored!While 2022 was filled with bad crypto actors like Alameda and 3AC choosing to fight tooth-and-nail until the end, hoping to win it all back in that one ever-elusive trade, Silvergate took the high road, electing to protect depositors and other creditors at the expense of their institutional pride.Silicon Valley's FinestLike wildfires and FOMO, bank run fever spreads rapidly; landing a spot on Forbes’ “America’s Best Banks” and “Financial All-Stars” lists proved insufficient in saving startup banking darling Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) from the clutches of financial disaster.After Silvergate’s liquidation announcement, SVB announced Thursday, March 9th, that it would raise additional liquidity à la $2.25B in share sales, with the offering consisting of $1.25B in public market common stock sales, $500M in depository shares, and an additional $500M in common stock sales directly to private equity firm General Atlantic (talk about a shit investment 😵‍💫). Earlier that day, SVB had been forced to sell $21B in US Treasury and agency MBS securities, causing the firm to record an after-tax loss of $1.8B in Q1 2023.Potentially spooked by the failure of Silvergate, prominent venture firms, including Founders Fund, Coatue Management, Union Square Ventures, Founder Collective, Canaan, Y Combinator, and Activant Capital, advised startups to withdraw capital from SVB on Thursday, commencing a good ole’ fashioned bank run.Attempting to shore up depositor confidence, SVB CEO Greg Becker held a 10-minute call, imploring the bank’s clients, including their venture capitalist backers, to continue to support the bank in the same way they had for the past 40 years.It’s safe to say Becker’s request was a resounding failure and was met with $42B in withdrawals. Outflows were so significant, not even the bank’s $21B in asset sales provided sufficient liquidity, with SVB having a negative cash balance of $958M at the end of Thursday.Enter RegulatoorsDespite SVB’s best efforts, with assistance from banking regulators, to transfer collateral from various sources, the bank was unable to meet its cash letter with the Federal Reserve, with “precipitous deposit withdrawals [having] caused the Bank to be incapable of paying its obligations as they come due” according to the California banking regulator that took possession of the firm Friday morning.Regulatory filings paint a bleak picture of the bank's financial standing.Source: State of California - Department of Financial Protection and InnovationThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) took receivership of the bank and spun up the Deposit Insurance National Bank of Santa Clara, transferring all insured deposits to the newly formed bank. Insured deposits were accessible as of Monday morning, however uninsured depositors who were unable to withdraw before the close of business on Thursday were initially stuck with “receivership certificates,” representing their claims on SVB’s remaining assets, with recovery rates subject to value received from the FDIC’s sale of SVB assets.SVB is the first FDIC-insured bank to fail since 2020 and second-largest in history, landing a spot on the unenviable list right below Seattle-based Washington Mutual, which failed in the midst of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis.We have just witnessed the second largest bank failure in U.S. history.

Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse marks the largest bank failure since 2008.

Just 24 hours ago, $SIVB was trading at $200/share.

When a bank collapses that quickly, something is wrong.

This is not healthy.— The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) March 10, 2023

A Big Beautiful Balance SheetSVB, as a banking entity, is remarkable for more reasons other than its untimely demise.Liabilities:The bank’s primary liability: deposits, totaled to $173B at year end 2022.For Silicon Valley’s startups, SVB was the go to banker. Half of all venture-backed startups have exposure to the collapse.Many companies and funds have not commented on their exposure to SVB.

If a company does NOT have exposure, you would have already heard.

50% of all venture-backed startups in the US have accounts with SVB.

More than 2,500 funds have accounts with SVB.

Silence is a bad sign.— The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) March 12, 2023

Post-COVID, startups valuations were sky-high, with venture firms fueling the fire and pouring a record $621B into these early-stage companies across the globe, with the majority going to Silicon Valley-based startups.This surge in funding activity was a boon for business at SVB, with deposits increasing by 233% from just over $60B in 2020 to nearly $200B at the end of Q1 2022.While fruitful in the bull market, the reliance on startup fundraising and revenue generation proved disastrous in later quarters of 2022 and at the start of 2023, as these firms began draining deposits for cash expenditures.Venture funding hits 9 year low:

- VC firms raised $20.6bn Q4, a 65% drop from the year-earlier quarter and the lowest Q4 amount since 2013

- LPs invested in 226 VC funds in Q4 2022 compared to 620 funds in Q4 2021 pic.twitter.com/SvEwl0apBr— Science Is Strategic (@scienceisstrat1) February 20, 2023

SVB even acknowledged these risks in their 10-K filing stating, “Decreases in the amount of equity capital available to our clients could adversely affect our business, growth and profitability.” The firm’s core business strategy was centered around banking and providing financial services to “companies, investors, entrepreneurs, and influencers in the innovation economy.” Typical banks have many types of depositors, consisting of a mix of cash flowing corporates, income earning individuals, and other diverse clientele. SVB had a high concentration of depositors in one of the most interest rate sensitive sectors of the economy.As financial conditions tightened, net deposits turned to net withdrawals, stressing SVB’s solvency.Assets:Concern was centered primarily around the bank’s $91B in held-to-maturity (HTM) securities.GAAP accounting standards give favorable treatment to financial entities booking their assets as HTM. Opposed to SVB’s AFS assets, where losses from increases in interest rates were reflected in decreases to the fair market value on the balance sheet, HTM securities are recorded at their purchase price.For SVB, this meant  $15B in unrealized losses on HTM securities were not recorded on the balance sheet with insufficient equity capital to absorb losses, providing an illusion of stronger solvency than existed.While SVB was unique in its vulnerability to unrealized security losses to wipe out it equity (CET1) many other US banks would have 1/3 to 1/2 of their capital wiped out if losses are realized. Even a modest run on their deposits will force them to sell some securities like SVB pic.twitter.com/p3Cumf4DPZ— Nouriel Roubini (@Nouriel) March 12, 2023

Unfortunately, SVB is not the only banking entity sitting on massive unrealized losses on its HTM security portfolio. All major banking and financial institutions have significant exposure to fixed-rate instruments, and thus unrealized losses hiding behind favorable accounting treatment...as you earn coupons over time and don't face P&L volatility.

The flipside is when you need liquidity.

Banks can only sell a small portion of HTM bonds before being ''tainted'' as non-compliant from regulators.

The large extent of HTM hidden losses is worrying some.

Bailouts-on-DemandSunday evening, the feds showed their cards.Joint action from the Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and the FDIC laid out a path towards resolution. Regulators hope this will stymie additional bank runs.In a statement, regulators confirm that all depositors, both insured and uninsured, of SVB and Signature will have full access to deposits as of Monday morning, with no losses of the resolution being borne by taxpayers. Any shortfalls from asset sales to cover uninsured depositor claims will instead be “recovered by a special assessment on banks, as required by law.”Signature Bank was revealed to have been taken over by regulators in the announcement, with a similar program announced for their insured and uninsured depositors, marking the third bank to fail this week and the third largest ever in the United States.Simultaneously came a new Fed program, called the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP). How does this new alphabet soup lending program work?The BTFP will offer term loans to banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other eligible depository institutions on US Treasuries, agency debt and MBS, and whatever “other qualifying assets” means as collateral.The kicker? The Fed is lending out on these securities at par!Forget about all those unrealized losses on HTM securities banks have accrued: the Fed is stepping in and lending not on the market value of these instruments, but on the future promised repayment.Essentially, Jerome Powell is offering undercollateralized loans to banking institutions. Across the pond in Great Britain and absent the powers imbued by the American money printer, the UK’s Finance Minister scrambled to piece together a deal to protect the nation’s startup industry, disrupted by the collapse of SVB UK. Thankfully, HSBC’s UK division announced a purchase of the bank, for a meager £1.Another Helping of Crypto ContagionCrypto stablecoins and firms were swept out to sea in the Silvergate/SVB/Signature riptide, as well.After the announcement of SVB’s receivership, it became immediately apparent that crypto’s golden boy stablecoin, USDC, was in trouble. Circle’s lack of transparency was of no help, with an official announcement of the amount of funds trapped in SVB, one of Circle’s reserve banks, not coming until Friday evening, when the stablecoin issuer announced that $3.3B of the approximately $40B backing USDC were trapped in the failed bank.1/ Following the confirmation at the end of today that the wires initiated on Thursday to remove balances were not yet processed, $3.3 billion of the ~$40 billion of USDC reserves remain at SVB.— Circle (@circle) March 11, 2023

Circle held reserve accounts not only with the failed SVB, but also with the (solvent) Silvergate AND the recently-placed-into-receivership Signature. Thank non-denominational Jesus the Feds announced that bailout plan!it's nuts that 3/6 of circle's banks just disappeared over a weekend pic.twitter.com/nu49Yf9AIE— Rooter 2️⃣ (@0xrooter) March 12, 2023

Liquidity vanished on-chain, as stablecoin HOLDers panic-swapped their USDC and USDC-backed DAI and FRAX stables for the once-suspect USDT.USDC fell to an all-time low of $0.82 on centralized exchanges, with limited liquidity on-chain pushing price even lower in many on-chain pools.Fundamentally representing claims on US dollars stored in reserve accounts with various depository institutions and money market funds, the weekend closure of the trad banking system presented a hurdle to USDC redemptions. Without credible threat-of-redemptions, fiat-backed stablecoins are essentially a game of trust; just like the banks (and UST), this category of stablecoin is also subject to runs and no one was looking to be to be the HODLer of last resort, causing panic selling.Tl;Dr: While USDC can be used 24/7/365 on chain, issuance and redemption is constrained by the working hours of the U.S. banking system.

USDC liquidity operations will resume as normal when banks open on Monday morning in the United States. As a practical matter, our teams are… https://t.co/6Y3SGop4t2— Jeremy Allaire (@jerallaire) March 11, 2023

During the chaos, while the status of the SVB deposits remained unclear, Circle announced that it would stand by its legal obligation as a money transmitter and backstop any shortfalls in USDC reserves.While this proved unnecessary, Circle remains in the weeds. This weekend’s shenanigans have potentially given Greedy Gary Gensler an “in” to regulating crypto’s most prolific stablecoin offering.I guess crypto is finally going bankless… At least the regulators kicked a bunch of our frens in Operation Chokepoint 2.0 a month ago!The clear winner here appears to be BNY Mellon, who will be taking custody of all of Circle’s SVB (and presumably Silvergate and Signature?) deposits and serving as the stablecoin issuer’s sole settlement layer while they look to onboard additional transaction partners.Hair-Trigger DepositoorsPerhaps one of the scariest lessons of the collapse of SVB is the realization that a technologically enabled society in times of economic panic is a massive threat to the stability of the fractional reserve banking system.In the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, concerns of solvency were driven by the toxic quality of bank assets. While we haven’t (yet) seen defaults on loan portfolios, it is undeniable that banks are holding a massive grab-bag of mixed duration treasuries with significant unrealized losses.Bank accounts are paying depositors close to zero, while those with uninsured accounts remain technically exposed to a complete loss of their funds. Sophisticated investors are quickly recognizing the ability to earn yield in money market funds, which exposes them to a fraction of the financial risk.While BTFP has changed the paradigm, allowing banks to monetize the spread between the market value of certain securities and par, banks still hold loan portfolios they are unable to use as collateral assets, and are still susceptible to run risk.Dodd-Frank, the last banking system overhaul, was written in 2010, a time when many tech companies were in their infancy or had not yet to be created. Online banking was nascent and cumbersome. Those banking habits would be considered antiquated by today’s standards.Digital customer experience in banking was improving, but many people, certainly more than today, still relied on branches to deposit checks, met with their bankers and everything had a lot more friction. And communication innovations of social media were in their infancy.— professorstam.eth (@ProfessorStam) March 12, 2023

When regulators set risk frameworks, even in max panic mode, significant drawdowns in assets would take time; an SVB-style bank run with a one-day 25% decrease in deposits would not have been possible.Not only has the advent of online banking made withdrawing funds easier than ever before, but the ability for fear to sweep through social media like wildfire has become a clear and present danger. Regardless of whether or not the SVB panic was necessary, concerns of solvency from a few credible players proved sufficient to cause it.There was no time for investigation, no time for nuance, it was time to move, and move fast. Pull out your phone, check twitter quick to verify, switch to your SVB app and conduct a wire transfer (I'm assuming its a similar process to my business account at Chase).— professorstam.eth (@ProfessorStam) March 12, 2023

When your bank is making the rounds on Twitter as the next potential bank run candidate, will you sit idly by, crossing your fingers and hoping for the best, or decide to take action and preserve the security of your family or business?While the FDIC’s recent coverage of uninsured depositors has provided one less reason to worry, there is no guarantee that this coverage will extend to future bankruns.SVB presents an interesting case study of the havoc a technologically savvy, uninsured depositor base can wreak on their bank and adds another massive concern to regulators' plates.It's scary to think, but the same types of tactics that can manipulate an election can be used to undermine the strength of a bank. This time around, it was pointing to unrealized losses on high quality assets to pile on and justify a panic. But it can manifest from anything.— professorstam.eth (@ProfessorStam) March 12, 2023

How Much Worse Could It Get™?Fact sets behind every bank run are unique; the most recent have been runs on technically insolvent banks with high amounts of unrealized losses on HTM security portfolios and limited equity capitalization.The next bank run will likely be spurned by concerns of default.As the United States and the world edges towards recession, the probability of loan portfolio defaults become more credible. Higher interest rates and potential for widespread layoffs are a deadly cocktail for borrower default.On Sunday, the Fed stopped the bleeding and cauterized the financial system’s open arteries with BTFP. If defaults tick up, banks will be in a world of pain, with no bailout plan in sight as their technologically savvy buyers claw past each other on the way out the door.Despite appearances, this is not a healthy market.Bullish???While central banking policy has kept interest rates artificially low for decades and financial entities remain propped on the crumbling foundations of unrealized losses in asset portfolios, I feel the tide has begun to shift.Papa Powell has given the banks carte blanche!Did i say 50bps? Oh no, sorry, I meant 50 trillion will be the bare minimum for the next QE. This rod? Oh, that's my switch. I use it on the bears when they begin to piss me off. Stop with the questions already. Just go all in on the index. You don't have long. pic.twitter.com/R9ndume8Ng— Blerk (@Blerk52) March 13, 2023

When I say “the banks,” I mean all of the banks, including foreign ones.Assuming that tomorrow’s CPI print can come in at or below expectation, Powell has minimal incentive to raise; things are beginning to break in the financial system and that is Powell’s sign to let his hands off the economy’s neck.Quantitative easing is back, inflation is dying, and although Powell is going to wish he could have just choked off inflation now, doing so risks collapsing the financial system. That’s the funny thing though: in all reality, we are only kicking this can down the road. It will show up as inflation in a couple month’s time. For now, we very well appear to be risk-on.Crisis averted; live again to fight another day, soldier!Remember anon: the streets are tough out there!

Today, we dig into USDC's chaotic depeg over the weekend, and how the overall stablecoin and DeFi markets reacted to it. - Bankless team The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank on March 10 sent shockwaves through the crypto ecosystem, when Circle, the issuer of USDC, announced that they had $3.3B in deposits (roughly 8% of their backing at the time) at the bank. This announcement caused a panic among holders of USDC, which de-pegged significantly as backers feared that there would be a run on the stablecoin if Circle was unable to be made whole on its SVB deposits. Jack gave an excellent breakdown of the crisis and its resolution yesterday, so I won’t give you another play by play. Instead , we’ll take a look at how the markets and DeFi reacted to the crisis. In particular, we’ll try to answer some questions such as: Which other stables depegged (to either the upside or downside)? How did this crisis affect DeFi? Did anything break? Let’s dig in so we can answer these questions. USDC/USDT - Source: DexScreener What De-Pegged, What Traded at a Premium? We all know that USDC de-pegged, having traded as low as $0.80 on some venues, but it was not the only stablecoin to experience instability over the weekend. Just about every other stablecoin endured well above average volatility between March 10-11, whether it be to the upside or the downside. I never thought I’d say this - but let’s touch on some of the noteworthy stablecoin price action below. DAI DAI/USDT - Source: DexScreener DAI, crypto’s fourth largest stablecoin is 43% collateralized by USDC via the peg-stability module (PSM) and G-UNI LP positions. The stablecoin traded as low as $0.886 during the panic, with the market fearing that it could be at risk of becoming undercollateralized should USDC continue to fall in value or experience a run. The price of MKR, the protocol's governance token, also plummeted on the back of these fears, falling 26.1% as traders were likely anticipating a potential need for the token to be minted in order to serve as a backstop to satisfy redemptions.","Dear Bankless Nation, With crypto markets surging over the past couple days, it might be easy to forget just how uncertain everything felt a good 48 hours ago.

This decline is likely due to trader concern that a USDC implosion would result in FRAX redemptions, which in turn would lead to the minting, and subsequent sale onto the market, of FXS.USDTThe largest stablecoin by market cap, Tether has come under heavy criticism for its opacity relative to its competitors. However, perhaps due to its perceived limited exposure to the US banking system, USDT acted as a safe haven during the crisis. The stablecoin largely traded near, and at times even above, peg.DeFi users even “fled to USDT” pulling it from liquidity pools and lending rather than risk exposure to USDC or USDC-exposed assets such as DAI and FRAX (more on this later).LUSD and sUSDLUSD/USDC 5D - Source: DexScreenerLiquity’s LUSD and Synthetix’s sUSD both traded at premiums throughout the crisis, with both trading as high as $1.08 on some DEXs during the height of the panic. Like USDT, these assets were utilized as safe havens during the crisis. However, rather than value its lack of ties to the United States, the market placed a premium on each stablecoin's exclusive use of crypto collateral.In the case of Liquity, this would be ETH, as LUSD can only be minted from this trustless bearer asset. Despite sUSD utilizing SNX, and not ETH, as collateral, traders still greatly valued its decentralization properties during the crisis.Curve PoolsCurve pools serve as sources of deep liquidity for stablecoins, as they have proven highly attractive to LPs due to the low risk of impairment loss in like-asset pools as well as the ability to earn CRV emissions. Curve pools also serve as a gauge (pun intended) on how the market views the risk of a given stablecoin. As pools becoming imbalanced (i.e., not having an equal ratio of each stable), it can indicate what assets LPs view as more or less risky.With this in mind, let’s take a look at how the composition of Curve pools changed during the crisis starting with the 3Pool, the largest pool on Curve which consists of USDT, USDC, and DAI.Curve 3Pool 7D Composition - Source: ParsecAs we can see, LPs fled to USDT during the height of the panic, seeking to reduce their exposure to USDC and DAI. During the peak of the panic on the night of March 10, the 3Pool became heavily imbalanced, holding just 1.5% USDT. On March 11, liquidity providers sought to further decrease their exposure to USDC by draining the pool of DAI, which had as low as an 8.5% composition of the pool.Considering that the 3Pool is in theory supposed to have ⅓ of each stable, this is a massive imbalance. Although it’s recovered somewhat, as of writing the pool continues to remain heavily imbalanced, with a composition of 47.1% USDC, 46.6% DAI, and 6.3% USDT.Curve 3CRV-LUSD 7D Composition - Source: ParsecStablecoin holders in other pools sought to flee USDC as well. For instance, the LUSD pool had a high imbalance of 95.5% USDC compared to just 4.5% LUSD.The through-line is clear - liquidity providers fled stablecoins that were exposed to USDC towards ones that were not. Although they have become more so, the pools remain heavily imbalanced against USDC, suggesting that some fear remains in the market.Lending MarketsNow, let’s see how lending markets reacted to the crisis.USDC Aave V2 Rates 3/10-3/14 - Source: ParsecThere was significant volatility in interest rates in both directions on these markets, with borrow rates for USDC plummeting from 3.4% to 2.1% on Aave V2 on Ethereum. Rates for DAI followed a similar trajectory, falling from 2.9% to 0.9%.LUSD Aave V2 Rates 3/10-3/14 - Source: ParsecNotably, interest rates for stablecoins that traded near peg or at premium like USDT, LUSD, and sUSD soared during this period. For instance, borrow rates for LUSD rose as high as 75% on March 11, with utilization for the asset soaring during this time.While at first glance it may appear as though borrowers were shorting these latter stablecoins, in reality the high rates are likely due to users pulling these assets in order to get out of Aave, which had heavy exposure to USDC and DAI. This means that during the crisis Aave experienced a mini-run of its own, but unlike meatspace banks such as SVB, the protocol continued to operate without issue.Ethereum Liquidations - Source: EigenPhiAlong with withstanding a “mini-run”, lending protocols like Aave were able to facilitate liquidations without a hitch amidst the volatility. Per MEV analytics site EigenPhi, there were more than $11.9M in liquidations between March 10-11, with major lenders like Aave (both V2 and V3) and Compound sitting on just ~$800K of bad debt. This accounts for just 0.014% of the combined TVL across these protocols.Bad Debt Per Lending Market - Source: RiskDAODid Anything Break?
So, with all of this instability in stablecoins… did anything break?The answer is, not really. Although liquidity providers fled to non-USDC stablecoins, no protocols “broke” as a result of the de-peg. As it’s been throughout the bear market, DeFi was resilient, facilitating liquidations that resulted from the volatility -- lending protocols accrued little bad debt as a result of the crisis.Despite this, there are lessons to be learned from the crisis. First and foremost, it’s become clear that DeFi must reduce its dependence on fiat-backed stablecoins that are beholden to the fragility of TradFi. It also revealed potential vulnerabilities.In addition, the panic demonstrated that decentralized assets command premiums during times of crisis. While we saw a “flight to safety” with the price of BTC and ETH actually increasing from March 10-11, and stablecoins like LUSD and sUSD, which are both backed solely by crypto collateral, traded at premiums over the weekend.Action Steps📖 Read yesterday's article How a Few Banks Lost Everything All at Once",https://www.bankless.com/stablecoin-pandemonium,2023-03-14T00:00:00.000Z,https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/2023/03/Screenshot_2023-03-14_at_11.51.53_AM-2.jpg,Ben Giove,Bankless,blog,Unknown Error,

However, recent events have illuminated the fragility of fractionalized banking.The rapid realization of insolvency at Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature, two banks declared “unsafe” by regulators and taken into FDIC receivership, provides a warning to the crypto startup community. Hopefully the message was received!Today, we’re discussing the dependency of protocol success on trad-banked core teams, concentration risks of (crypto) startup banks, and the on-chain crypto native solutions to the problems they face.Protocol DependenceBehind many successful protocols are centralized groups of developers providing front-end access to on-chain smart contracts and building out future roadmap items.Uniswap has Uniswap Labs. GMX has GMX Labs. Balancer has Balancer Labs.Each is crucial to the success of the protocol they derive their namesake from. While decentralized token holders are often afforded governance rights to protocols and may be able to adjust certain smart contract risk parameters, they are generally not building the protocols themselves or providing easy access to the on-chain backend, placing tremendous faith in and reliance on the “Labs” side of the equation.Success of the two unique entities is intertwined, with core teams receiving token allocations in exchange for the tremendous value they provide to the protocol. Like traditional startups, crypto’s “Labs” corporations rely on the traditional banking system. While it is extremely likely that the majority of such firms were banking with crypto-friendly banks (SVB alone boasted business relationships with half of US startups), very few publicly disclosed any business with Signature, Silvergate or SVB. Hmm.As a significant outlier, PROOF Collective -- a members-only community behind multiple successful NFT projects, including Moonbirds, Oddities, Grails, and Emotes -- provided more transparency than most into its SVB exposure via an early tweet thread.2/5: In the spirit of transparency, here’s everything we know about the situation with SVB:

Proof holds cash at SVB, however…
We’ve thankfully diversified our assets across ETH, stablecoins, as well as fiat—so financially and operationally, we’re going to be OK.— PROOF (🥃,🦉) (@proof_xyz) March 10, 2023

With some of the team’s USD deposits trapped at SVB, it is clear that the failure of the FDIC to insure all depositors would have been detrimental to PROOF’s runway. Thankfully for Kevin Rose and the rest of the PROOF community, the FDIC stepped in, insuring all uninsured depositors at SVB. But PROOF's efforts towards transparent still negatively impacted the floor prices of many PROOF NFTs. Unsurprisingly, teams behind liquid token projects did not seem to be racing to announce such banking difficulties; it's highly likely that project tokens would have nuked as access to front-ends and completion of future roadmap items came into question.Banking DilemmaBanking options for crypto startups are fairly limited, and with three central options (Silvergate, SVB, and Signature) all collapsing last week, it isn't unlikely that your average protocol’s core team had significant exposure to the collapse.Not only did these banks serve as crypto startups’ primary nexus into the traditional banking system, they also served as the banks for many early-stage companies. Again, around half of all US-based startups had exposure to SVB!Many companies and funds have not commented on their exposure to SVB.

If a company does NOT have exposure, you would have already heard.

50% of all venture-backed startups in the US have accounts with SVB.

More than 2,500 funds have accounts with SVB.

Silence is a bad sign.— The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) March 12, 2023

While low interest rates proved a boon for startups in late 2020 and throughout 2021, heightened interest rates cooled early-stage funding. Venture firms reduced checks amounts, meanwhile the startups banking at SVB that weren’t profitable when they were funded remained unprofitable, continuing to burn cash.Net inflows turned to withdrawals at these startup-centric banks, stressing cash balances of these banks and forcing them to sell securities and realize losses. Additionally, high degrees of uninsured accounts at both SVB and Signature gave depositors even more reason to panic as bank run rumors engulfed CT.Uninsured deposits range from 37-59% of total deposits at most of US banks vs 90% at SVB & Signature. BofA, Regions, Wells Fargo had lowest share of uninsured deposits at 37% each. Citi had highest share of uninsured dep at 85% given institutional focused deposit franchise.

Account holders rightfully feared for the future success of their business, making the risk prudent choice and pulling funds.Compared to a more traditional bank, such as JP Morgan or Wells Fargo where depositors are not only early stage companies, but also include cash flowing corporations and income-earning individuals, the banks that collapsed had significantly heightened concentration risk.Part of this concentration risk is due to the specialized needs of banking startups, in addition to the regulatory hurdles faced by banks choosing to bank crypto firms and other “less desirable” banking clientele, including taboo marijuana and sex-related industries. This forces startups and crypto firms to bank with boutique options, a great idea when business is good, but one that is highly exposed to the cyclicality of their depositor’s industries and faces large degrees of risk in economic downturns.😬 Managing RiskNo one wants their project to be the poster child of why cash management is important if we see another bank run. Assuming you’re unable to get an account at a too-big-to fail JP Morgan or Wells Fargo, do not fear! There are some solutions:Decentralized StablesRAI and LUSD are your friends, anon. Yes! I understand that these are not as capital efficient as competitive forms of stablecoins, but in times of banking uncertainty, you pay for security.Once considered the golden standard of stablecoins, USDC’s weekend depeg to $0.82 on centralized exchanges displays one of the fundamental flaws in the design of centralized stablecoins: trust.Last weekend, USDC holders no longer trusted that they may be able to redeem one coin for one US dollar. With trad banking systems offline, redemptions were not able to be processed. Panic ensued with uncertainty over how much of the $3.3B trapped in SVB would be recovered. Just like the bank run on SVB, a bank run could occur on any centralized stablecoin with inadequate collateral backing.The spillover impacted USDC-backed decentralized stablecoins, including DAI and FRAX, with USDT the favored option.🚨CURVE IMBALANCE REACHING CRITICAL LEVELS, NOW ONLY $15 MILLION $USDT LEFT. https://t.co/yeogFJWQ2K pic.twitter.com/MmpuRkbnJc— DIRTY BUBBLE MEDIA: ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED? (@MikeBurgersburg) March 11, 2023

Keep in mind, anon, that USDT is a riskier alternative to US regulated centralized stablecoin options, including USDC, GUSD, and USDP. While Tether claims to have gotten rid of its commercial paper holdings in October, we have minimal insight into the reserves backing the stablecoin, other than the fact that (so far) they have been able to process redemptions.Opting to use Ether-backed LUSD and RAI, where proof of solvency can be verified on-chain and is dependant solely on the protocol’s ability to liquidate undercollateralized positions, is a much safer alternative in today’s banking environment.Managing ExpensesCrypto is starting to develop solutions to payroll and expense invoices! While startups may still be forced to pay some vendors with assistance of traditional banks, their employees and crypto native partners would likely welcome the usage of innovative crypto payments systems.One such option is LlamaPay, a payments streaming platform from the folks over at DeFi Llama. A simplistic UI allows the streaming of both salaries and payments, with additional features for token vesting and token salaries. LlamaPay is far from perfect, however it is a step in the right direction towards tackling an issue more teams should be focused on.Source: LlamaPayManagement of payroll and other expenses on-chain enables the “Labs” companies crucial to the success of our favorite crypto protocols to minimize funds stored in the traditional banking system and avoid the next banking collapse.Limit ExposureGoing completely off-chain (being bankless) is not a feasible solution for many companies, yet storing unused funds in Ether-backed, decentralized stablecoins and switching to on-chain expense payment solutions can be a step in the right direction.Participating in the financial system entails risk, however mitigating that risk can be accomplished with foresight and by maximizing usage of crypto-native primitives.Don’t be caught off guard by the next bank run, anon: now is the time to prepare.🫡",https://www.bankless.com/is-defi-too-reliant-on-banks,2023-03-15T00:00:00.000Z,https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/2023/03/267_Newsletter_DeFi_is_banked_031523-2.jpg,Jack Inabinet,Bankless,blog,Unknown Error,

ARB will be used to participate in the Arbitrum DAO, which will govern over the Arbitrum ecosystem including Arbitrum One (the “main” L2 which most refer to as just Arbitrum), and Arbitrum Nova. Notably, Arbitrum will be the first L2 to have “self-executing governance,” meaning that governance will happen entirely on-chain and that proposals do not have to be implemented manually by the core team. Arbitrum is also creating what’s known as the “Arbitrum Security Council,” which is a 9/12 multi-sig that will have the authority to make changes to the rollup in the event of a security emergency. The composition of the Security Council will be determined by the DAO. It also appears that tokenholders will control the rights to Arbitrum IP, as DAO governance has the ability to approve the creation of other L2s that settle to Ethereum which are built using Arbitrum's tech. These L2s can either be governed by ARB holders (a governed chain), or have their own independent governance system (an ungoverned chain). DAO governance does not have to approve the creation of L3s that settle to Arbitrum itself (more on this later). Did we miss anything? Oh right. There WILL be an ARB airdrop to early participants within the ecosystem, and the token is set to go live on March 23. You can check your eligibility here. How it this airdrop being distributed? So, 11.62 percent of the total 10 billion token supply will be airdropped to individual user wallets. Otherwise, the lion's share is going to the DAO treasury (∼43%) with ∼27% being reserved for the team and a healthy ∼17.5% going to the project's investors. The remaining ∼1% will be going to DAOs in the Arbitrum ecosystem. Arbitrum snapshotted user activity February 3 and will award tokens based on the number of transactions completed, applications used, and time spent on the network.","No, your eyes do not deceive you. This is not a drill.At long last, ARB is here. Arbitrum is (finally) dropping its token.One of the most anticipated token launches in crypto history, ARB will be used to govern over the Arbitrum ecosystem, and yes, will be airdropped to early users.But that’s not the only big news of the day. Arbitrum has also announced Arbitrum Orbit, a framework for creating L3s that settle to Arbitrum-based rollups. Have a few minutes to take a break from watching TradFi immolate? If so, I’ll break down all you need to know about ARB and Orbit, their impact on the Arbitrum ecosystem, and how these releases are set to shake up the increasingly fierce “Layer 2 Wars.” Let’s dive in.🥏 Tl;dr of ARB Let’s break down what we know so far about ARB.ARB will be used to participate in the Arbitrum DAO, which will govern over the Arbitrum ecosystem including Arbitrum One (the “main” L2 which most refer to as just Arbitrum), and Arbitrum Nova.Notably, Arbitrum will be the first L2 to have “self-executing governance,” meaning that governance will happen entirely on-chain and that proposals do not have to be implemented manually by the core team.

The remaining ∼1% will be going to DAOs in the Arbitrum ecosystem.Arbitrum snapshotted user activity February 3 and will award tokens based on the number of transactions completed, applications used, and time spent on the network.🛰 Tl;dr of Arbitrum OrbitNow, it’s time to take a look at today’s second big announcement from Arbitrum…Orbit!As mentioned above, Arbitrum Orbit is a development framework for creating Layer 3s (L3s).L3s are “L2s for L2s” in that they refer to a rollup that settles to another L2, rather than an L1. L3s still retain the security guarantees of an L2 but have the potential to provide a massive increase in scalability, as throughput compounds in each layer of the stack.For example, let’s say an L3 has a 10x increase in throughput relative to an L2, and an L2 has a 10x increase in throughput compared with L1. This means that the L3 has a 100x increase in throughput over L1. This massive increase in scalability means that L3s are well suited for use cases like order-book exchanges, games, or other high throughput use cases that require incredibly fast and cheap transactions.Orbit is permissionless, as developers can use the tech to create an L3 that settles to an Arbitrum Chain without requiring the permission of the DAO. Orbit will also be compatible with Arbitrum Stylus, a future upgrade that will enable developers to build dapps in traditional programming languages including C, C++ and Rust.💰 Impact on The Arbitrum EconomyNow, that we have a tldr of ARB and Orbit, let’s touch on the ways in which they will impact the Arbitrum economy.Arbi Szn (V3)The airdrop of ARB should serve as a stimulus for the Arbitrum economy, creating a wealth effect in early adopters by providing them with capital with which they can ape.This should not come as a surprise to all the degens out there, but Arbitrum-based governance tokens are set to be among the primary beneficiaries from this airdrop. For one, they are set to be the recipients of airdrop stimmy, but also will benefit from the capital set to pour into the ecosystem from incentive programs (more on that below).Broadly speaking, Arbitrum coins have had two periods in which they’ve outperformed over the past year: The summer of 2022 and first six weeks of 2023, coinciding with broader market rallies during these times.Arbitrum Tokens 1YR Chart - Source: TradingViewWhile some of this most recent rally may have been due to anticipation of the airdrop, given the insatiable desire to speculate among on-chain degens who are armed with fresh ammo, it is likely that we’ll still see a V3 of “Arbi Szn.”Other than structural flows, there are fundamental reasons to be bullish on Arbitrum-based tokens over the coming weeks and months. Armed with ARB incentives to fuel usage, projects on the L2 should see increases in revenue, users, and other core KPIs as users flock and capital flows into the L2.Furthermore, these tokens should also benefit from a broader “L2 Trade,” as excitement around both Arbitrum’s individual growth story, and further confirmation of L2s as crypto's preeminent scaling solution, builds among traders. Want the alpha on individual Arbitrum tokens?  Sorry, but those are for Bankless Citizens only.We cover a host of Arbitrum tokens for Citizens via the Bankless Token Ratings, where our analyst team shares their outlook and alpha on projects native to the L2 including MAGIC, GMX, GNS, and GFLY.Our community is also constantly sharing research, alpha and plays in the Bankless Nation Discord server. If you aren’t one already, become a Citizen and level up your degen game today.Become a CitizenFarming Frenzy and Liquidity InfluxArbitrum already has a flourishing DeFi ecosystem, ranking first among L2s and fourth among all networks with a DeFi TVL of $1.6B.The L2 is already a degen’s paradise, with numerous spot and perpetuals DEXs, options protocols, and lending markets. Yield farmers have already been eating, but are set up for an even more bountiful harvest in a post-ARB world.This is because, as previously mentioned, ARB will likely be utilized by many projects for incentive programs. This will increase yields for farmers, who are now able to earn these ARB rewards on top of existing lending interest, trading fees and/or existing liquidity mining incentives.If history is our guide, these rewards programs should catalyze significant liquidity inflows into the Arbitrum ecosystem, and therefore, a massive increase in TVL, over the coming months.Optimism TVL - Source: DeFi LlamaFor instance, Optimism saw its TVL increase 232% from $269M to $894M in the three months following the release of OP. Given its already existing liquidity, ecosystem of dapps, and increased security guarantees (in its current state) relative to Optimism, it seems likely that Arbitrum will attract billions in inflows and grow at an even faster rate.🥊 Impact on the L2 WarsThe launch of ARB, the Arbitrum DAO, and Orbit will significantly shake up the L2 competitive landscape.Let’s highlight a few ways in which it will do so:Cementing Arbitrum’s DeFi MoatAs mentioned above Arbitrum currently has $1.6B in DeFi TVL, good for a 62.8% share among L2s and a 3.5% slice of TVL across all networks. The billions in liquidity inflows post-ARB, should not only lead to a marked increase in both categories, but also help Arbitrum cement its lead as the go-to L2 for DeFi by further strengthening the network effects it has from its current ecosystem of dapps.Users and developers go where the liquidity and other applications are. The release of ARB  and subsequent incentive programs should spur a substantial increase in both, and should help Arbitrum further distance itself from competitors like Optimism.In the long-run, there is a strong possibility that Arbitrum flips Tron and BNB Chain to become the second largest L1 or L2 by TVL.A (Potential) New Value Proposition for L2 TokensARB will also shake up the L2 landscape by imbuing its DAO with the rights to license Arbitrum’s IP.L2s already control their IP to varying degrees. For instance, Optimism’s OP Stack can be used without permission, with anyone able to fork Optimism mainnet or create their own L2 without needing governance approval. Other L2s act as service providers, but their development companies typically internalize all profits from this. A debate on the use of intellectual property within crypto goes beyond the scope of this article. But through this model, the Arbitrum DAO will now be the first major L2 to open source this process.This greatly increases the value proposition of ARB, as not only will it potentially be used to decentralize the sequencer in the future, but holders will also control the rights to incredibly valuable IP. We’ve seen some early signs of this model being used in crypto, with an example being Uniswap, whose DAO controls the business license for Uniswap V3. Some projects have approached UNI holders to seek permission to fork V3 such as Voltz, an interest rate swap protocol who allocated 1% of their token supply to the Uniswap DAO after being allowed to do so. However, likely due to the general inactivity of Uniswap governance, we’ve not seen many other examples. This means that we’re likely to see this model be utilized at scale for the first time with Arbitrum, and should it prove successful, likely pressure other L2 providers to follow suit.From Few To ManyBefore the announcement of Orbit, the Arbitrum ecosystem appeared to be largely concentrated around Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova.This ran counter to the approach of other L2s such as Optimism, who is developing a burgeoning ecosystem of networks built with the OP Stack, including Coinbase’s Base, Ribbon’s Aevo exchange, and Lattice’s on-chain game OPCraft. Other L2s such as zkSync are planning to build out extensive L3 ecosystems, while StarkWare has also provided the tech to build application specific validiums via StarkEx.In an L2 landscape that is becoming increasingly multi-rollup, particularly after the announcement of Base, it appeared as though Arbitrum may have been behind the 8-ball on this front. Orbit changes this.Orbit will likely turn Arbitrum One into a settlement layer (similar to ETH), and in doing so enable the broader Arbitrum ecosystem to scale over the long-run. Orbit should also increase the attractiveness of building a custom L2 within the Arbitrum ecosystem, as not only will applications benefit from the value that L3s provide such as the aforementioned increased throughput and secure bridging, but also from the interoperability and network effects of the existing Arbitrum ecosystem.It remains to be seen which L2 tech stack developers ultimately prefer - But Orbit has certainly leveled the playing field relative to the OP Stack. ARB IS HEREIt’s a big week.As TradFi burns, Arbitrum is set to shake up the L2 with the launch of ARB and Orbit.While the token is not yet live, ARB will already begin to impact markets and the broader L2 landscape.The L2 wars are far from over. But as of now, Arbitrum appears to be back in the driver's seat.",https://www.bankless.com/the-arb-arbitrum-airdrop-is-here,2023-03-16T00:00:00.000Z,https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/2023/03/268_Newsletter_Arbitrum_031523_Secondary_copy-1-2.jpg,Ben Giove,Bankless,blog,Unknown Error,

Setting the SceneArbitrum and Optimism are not only Ethereum heavyweights. They’re some of crypto’s largest chains by TVL.Sitting at the number four and six slots, split by he-who-must-not-be-named (Polygon), Arbitrum and Optimism have surpassed many of the bull market’s favorite alt-L1s in terms of TVL, including Avalanche, Fantom, and Solana. Source: DeFi LlamaWhile other chains have enjoyed increased TVL as broader crypto markets pumped, the 25% increase to Arbitrum TVL over the past seven days is notable. Liquidity is flowing to the chain in anticipation of the ARB drop.But it's not only a shift in liquidity, we’ve seen massive increases in the number of daily users on Arbitrum, hitting an all-time high of 172.4k active addresses on March 17th. Arbitrum’s DeFi core combined with March’s nutty price action were contributing factors to the rollup’s dominance this month, averaging 188% more active daily users than Optimism.We all remember when transactions on Arbitrum flipped the Ethereum L1 in late February. Far from a one-time occurrence, Arbitrum transactions yet again flipped Ethereum on March 16th and have held steady around the 1M mark since.Source: Token TerminalOptimism is the clear laggard, having fallen far off its all-time high of 800k transactions in January. The network has been unable to break over 300k daily transactions over the month of March.Token ShenanigansAnd you thought BLUR was big.Arbitrum will be dropping 12.75% of the total ARB supply to early users and 137 DAOs with an Arbitrum presence. Depending on which Crypto Twitter user you ask, we could soon see $ARB trade anywhere from $0.30 to an eye-popping $10! As nice as these fairly outlandish early predictions sounds, more reasonable (and quantitatively based) valuation frameworks see the token likely trade in and around the $1 to $2 range, which is exactly where the price of $ARB has seemed to settle after early volatile trading.Even when assuming the conservative $1 prediction as a base case, over $1B in value was just injected into the Arbitrum ecosystem.Projects on Optimism have long provided their users with OP token rewards, thanks to distributions from the chain’s Ecosystem Fund. Arbitrum has finally unlocked the ability to provide similar incentives to its protocols. While Arbitrum GMX dominance has declined to 25% of Arbitrum TVL, the degen-favored platform continues to rake in the dough, with just under $40M in fees collected over the past three months.Source: GMX AnalyticsYield farms on Arbitrum outside of GMX have continued to provide bountiful harvests, meanwhile shitcoin szn has been juicing yields on all of your favorite ArbiDEX casinos, including Camelot. Emergence of the GambleFi scene on Arbitrum appears poised to provide additional yield opportunities from degens who have grown tired of speculating solely on token price.ARB incentives on top of these yields likely funnel additional capital and liquidity into the Arbitrum ecosystem, especially when the 137 projects with allocations begin to announce the structure of their liquidity incentive and rewards programs.Chains with higher TVLs generally command higher FDVs. Polygon’s MATIC token has a fully diluted value of $11.5B, 2.9% greater than Optimism’s $11.2B FDV. While the gap between Polygon and Optimism TVL is not perfectly captured in this calculation, it displays the correlation between TVL and valuation for Ethereum-settling rollups.Data Source: DeFi Llama, CoinGeckoBetween Arbitrum’s DAO treasury and Optimism’s RetroPGF, Ecosystem, and Future Airdrop funds, untapped token incentives are available for both chains to flex in the never-ending battle for liquidity.Liquidity begets liquidity, which in turn begets valuations. Thanks to a (presumed) higher valuation for Arbitrum, the DAO will benefit from an inflated treasury valuation, giving it a greater amount of ammunition compared to Optimism. Effective usage of this treasury should translate to greater spending power, giving the DAO an advantage in attracting users and liquidity.Pulled into Arbitrum’s OrbitAs mentioned above, Arbitrum’s scaling roadmap is fundamentally different from Optimism’s.OP Stack will provide for the permissionless creation of L2s, affording anyone the ability to build modular chains from a codebase receiving contributions from Optimism, Coinbase, and other OP Stack developers. Inherently, OP Stack empowers Optimism competitors. While the future of the OP Stack aims to allow chains sharing sequencer sets the ability to conduct atomic transactions, there is no guarantee that a chain will opt into this shared security model.Optimism runs the risk that another general purpose rollup, built on its tech stack, may steal liquidity and users directly from the mother chain. There is also zero guarantee that these chains will be as charitable as Base and decide to share fee income with Optimism.The @BuildOnBase Chain will commit a portion of transaction fee revenue back to the Optimism Collective.

This furthers the Collective’s vision for a sustainable future where Impact = Profit.— Optimism (✨🔴_🔴✨) (@optimismFND) February 23, 2023

In comparison, Offchain Labs, the development team behind Arbitrum, is granting IP rights for the creation of L2s to the Arbitrum DAO, while allowing for the permissionless creation of L3s with the Orbit program. Instead of enabling the competition to spin up chains directly competing with Arbitrum, the DAO will have the ability to dictate terms and may even elect to prohibit L2 competitors to fork Arbitrum tech.Separating IP between permissioned L2 deployments and permissionless L3 deployments seems to give Arbitrum (and L3 devs) the best of both worlds. Developers on Orbit will be contributing to the leading L2 codebase, while inheriting the compression and programming advantages of Nitro and Stylus.Unlike OP Stack, Orbit provides a direct value accrual model for ARB token holders: L3s built on Arbitrum must pay fees to Arbitrum sequencers. This capture is unique to Arbitrum and is a novel solution to open-sourcing code and generating economic benefits. Forget about utility: the frontier of tokenomics is value accrual. ARB holders will benefit from the potential, eventually realized, fee generation machine that is L3s deployments on Arbitrum.ArbiDominanceFor too long, ARB has been absent from the wallets of crypto degens. Competition is the nexus of innovation, and as the consumer, I’m pleased with the massive leap forward Arbitrum has made on its roadmap.Token incentives and future airdrops will likely prove a potent tonic to attract new users and additional liquidity to the chain. How Optimism and other L2s react remains to be seen. Orbit changes the paradigm, displaying that it’s possible for L2s to align with crypto open-source values while embracing the inner capitalist and establishing revenue streams for token holders.The roadmap for ArbiDominance is clear: continue to build a world-class rollup to attract world-class dApps and L3s (incentivized by deeper liquidity and superior tech to build on the chain), continue to command a higher valuation than its competitors (due to increased development and user activity in combination with a higher TVL), and effectively employ token incentives and novel airdrop strategies to attract further liquidity!

Arbitrum will be dropping 12.75% of the total ARB supply to early users and 137 DAOs with an Arbitrum presence. Depending on which Crypto Twitter user you ask, we could soon see $ARB trade anywhere from $0.30 to an eye-popping $10! As nice as these fairly outlandish early predictions sounds, more reasonable (and quantitatively based) valuation frameworks see the token likely trade in and around the $1 to $2 range, which is exactly where the price of $ARB has seemed to settle after early volatile trading. Even when assuming the conservative $1 prediction as a base case, over $1B in value was just injected into the Arbitrum ecosystem. Projects on Optimism have long provided their users with OP token rewards, thanks to distributions from the chain’s Ecosystem Fund. Arbitrum has finally unlocked the ability to provide similar incentives to its protocols. While Arbitrum GMX dominance has declined to 25% of Arbitrum TVL, the degen-favored platform continues to rake in the dough, with just under $40M in fees collected over the past three months.

Emergence of the GambleFi scene on Arbitrum appears poised to provide additional yield opportunities from degens who have grown tired of speculating solely on token price. ARB incentives on top of these yields likely funnel additional capital and liquidity into the Arbitrum ecosystem, especially when the 137 projects with allocations begin to announce the structure of their liquidity incentive and rewards programs. Chains with higher TVLs generally command higher FDVs. Polygon’s MATIC token has a fully diluted value of $11.5B, 2.9% greater than Optimism’s $11.2B FDV. While the gap between Polygon and Optimism TVL is not perfectly captured in this calculation, it displays the correlation between TVL and valuation for Ethereum-settling rollups. Data Source: DeFi Llama, CoinGecko Between Arbitrum’s DAO treasury and Optimism’s RetroPGF, Ecosystem, and Future Airdrop funds, untapped token incentives are available for both chains to flex in the never-ending battle for liquidity. Liquidity begets liquidity, which in turn begets valuations. Thanks to a (presumed) higher valuation for Arbitrum, the DAO will benefit from an inflated treasury valuation, giving it a greater amount of ammunition compared to Optimism. Effective usage of this treasury should translate to greater spending power, giving the DAO an advantage in attracting users and liquidity.","Dear Bankless Nation,ARB has arrived! Oh, and also... Do Kwon got arrested. Coinbase is in the SEC cross-hairs. Justin Sun got sued. Jake Paul, Lindsey Lohan and other celebrities got Gary's attention because of crypto ads... This has been one hell of a week.Today, we focus our newsletter energy on Arbitrum and what the launch of the ARB token means for its future prospects as the undisputed L2 King.- Bankless teamL2 summer is now in full swing! How are we kicking it off? With crypto’s most anticipated airdrop of course: ARB. True believers have long foretold of the day; pessimists said it would never come! The time to scoop your ARB allocation is now.Long at stasis, the dynamic between two of Ethereum’s most popular Layer 2 rollup solutions is fundamentally shifting. Last week’s ARB announcement also provided clarity on how the Arbitrum team intends to scale the Arbitrum network, and thus the future of Ethereum.Arbitrum Orbit will allow for the permissionless creation of L3 chains – rollups settling to Arbitrum – while requiring DAO approval for the usage of Arbitrum IP to create L2s. This comes in stark contrast to the OP Stack “Superchain” vision, a model that opens-sources Optimism’s code for the permissionless creation of L2s with shared sequencer sets.Today, we’re exploring the Arbitrum v. Optimism competitive landscape at present, considering how ARB shakes up the current paradigm, and contrasting their differing approaches to achieving scale.

Setting the SceneArbitrum and Optimism are not only Ethereum heavyweights. They’re some of crypto’s largest chains by TVL.Sitting at the number four and six slots, split by he-who-must-not-be-named (Polygon), Arbitrum and Optimism have surpassed many of the bull market’s favorite alt-L1s in terms of TVL, including Avalanche, Fantom, and Solana. Source: DeFi LlamaWhile other chains have enjoyed increased TVL as broader crypto markets pumped, the 25% increase to Arbitrum TVL over the past seven days is notable. Liquidity is flowing to the chain in anticipation of the ARB drop.But it's not only a shift in liquidity, we’ve seen massive increases in the number of daily users on Arbitrum, hitting an all-time high of 172.4k active addresses on March 17th. Arbitrum’s DeFi core combined with March’s nutty price action were contributing factors to the rollup’s dominance this month, averaging 188% more active daily users than Optimism.We all remember when transactions on Arbitrum flipped the Ethereum L1 in late February. Far from a one-time occurrence, Arbitrum transactions yet again flipped Ethereum on March 16th and have held steady around the 1M mark since.Source: Token TerminalOptimism is the clear laggard, having fallen far off its all-time high of 800k transactions in January. The network has been unable to break over 300k daily transactions over the month of March.Token ShenanigansAnd you thought BLUR was big.Arbitrum will be dropping 12.75% of the total ARB supply to early users and 137 DAOs with an Arbitrum presence.

Effective usage of this treasury should translate to greater spending power, giving the DAO an advantage in attracting users and liquidity.Pulled into Arbitrum’s OrbitAs mentioned above, Arbitrum’s scaling roadmap is fundamentally different from Optimism’s.OP Stack will provide for the permissionless creation of L2s, affording anyone the ability to build modular chains from a codebase receiving contributions from Optimism, Coinbase, and other OP Stack developers. Inherently, OP Stack empowers Optimism competitors. While the future of the OP Stack aims to allow chains sharing sequencer sets the ability to conduct atomic transactions, there is no guarantee that a chain will opt into this shared security model.Optimism runs the risk that another general purpose rollup, built on its tech stack, may steal liquidity and users directly from the mother chain. There is also zero guarantee that these chains will be as charitable as Base and decide to share fee income with Optimism.The @BuildOnBase Chain will commit a portion of transaction fee revenue back to the Optimism Collective.

This furthers the Collective’s vision for a sustainable future where Impact = Profit.— Optimism (✨🔴_🔴✨) (@optimismFND) February 23, 2023

In comparison, Offchain Labs, the development team behind Arbitrum, is granting IP rights for the creation of L2s to the Arbitrum DAO, while allowing for the permissionless creation of L3s with the Orbit program. Instead of enabling the competition to spin up chains directly competing with Arbitrum, the DAO will have the ability to dictate terms and may even elect to prohibit L2 competitors to fork Arbitrum tech.Separating IP between permissioned L2 deployments and permissionless L3 deployments seems to give Arbitrum (and L3 devs) the best of both worlds. Developers on Orbit will be contributing to the leading L2 codebase, while inheriting the compression and programming advantages of Nitro and Stylus.Unlike OP Stack, Orbit provides a direct value accrual model for ARB token holders: L3s built on Arbitrum must pay fees to Arbitrum sequencers. This capture is unique to Arbitrum and is a novel solution to open-sourcing code and generating economic benefits. Forget about utility: the frontier of tokenomics is value accrual. ARB holders will benefit from the potential, eventually realized, fee generation machine that is L3s deployments on Arbitrum.ArbiDominanceFor too long, ARB has been absent from the wallets of crypto degens. Competition is the nexus of innovation, and as the consumer, I’m pleased with the massive leap forward Arbitrum has made on its roadmap.Token incentives and future airdrops will likely prove a potent tonic to attract new users and additional liquidity to the chain. How Optimism and other L2s react remains to be seen. Orbit changes the paradigm, displaying that it’s possible for L2s to align with crypto open-source values while embracing the inner capitalist and establishing revenue streams for token holders.The roadmap for ArbiDominance is clear: continue to build a world-class rollup to attract world-class dApps and L3s (incentivized by deeper liquidity and superior tech to build on the chain), continue to command a higher valuation than its competitors (due to increased development and user activity in combination with a higher TVL), and effectively employ token incentives and novel airdrop strategies to attract further liquidity!

In today's newsletter, we dig into the details of the Shanghai + Capella upgrades going live on the network tomorrow. - Bankless team Bankless Writers: Ben Giove and Jack Inabinet It’s Shapella szn! Years in the making, one of the most anticipated network upgrades in Ethereum’s history is here, with the Shapella upgrade set to go live around 6:00 pm EST tomorrow! Shapella represents the final milestone in Ethereum’s multi-year transition from Proof-Of-Work (PoW) to Proof-Of-Stake (PoS) consensus. It will enable Ethereum stakers/validators to withdraw their deposits from the Beacon Chain. The upgrade has significant implications for ETH and the staking landscape. As a result there’s been a torrent of discussion, threads, opinions (and misinformation) around the impact of the event. It’s easy to get lost in the noise - But we’re here to help you cut through it. You’ve got questions, we’ve got answers. Here’s everything you need to know about Shapella. 1. Shapella? Wasn’t this called Shanghai? Yes, the community initially rallied around the “Shanghai” moniker for withdrawals. But the more technically correct “Shapella” designation has found a home in crypto vernacular as of late. Shapella = Shanghai + Capella, with the new term referring to the implementation of the change that is occurring at both the network's execution and consensus layers. At the execution layer, Shanghai will create a new transaction type that will allow stakers to withdraw validator balances, while at the consensus layer, Capella will enable the Beacon Chain to accept a withdrawal request. Together, the two will imbue stakers with the ability to withdraw their deposits for the first time in Ethereum’s history.","Dear Bankless Nation, I'm sure you've heard, but it's a big week for Ethereum.

Why is there so much hype around Shapella?Shapella marks the completion of Ethereum’s transition to PoS.The first step was the “Merge”, which saw the merging of the Beacon Chain launched in December 2020, with the old PoW Ethereum chain. It went off without a hitch in September 2022. However, until this point, staking has been a one way street. Holders could deposit their ETH into the Beacon Chain and earn rewards, but could not withdraw any funds.Liquid staking derivatives (LSDs) like those from Lido Finance and Rocketpool partially mitigated this illiquidity, by providing liquidity for stakers through the issuance of tradable derivative tokens that represent a claim on their deposit.However, the ETH stake rate sits at just 14.9%. This is well below the 60.1% average for the top 20 PoS networks, and can likely be attributable in large part to both the technical and liquidity risks that currently exist with pre-Shapella ETH staking. This is why many believe that Shapella de-risks ETH staking, with withdrawals enabling an exit for stakers. As a result, it’s likely that Ethereum will undergo a “staking super cycle,” which refers to a surge in staking deposits that takes its stake rate closer to the mean.This expected staking boom has also helped fuel the enthusiasm around LSDs, which are expected to be one of the primary beneficiaries of this growth (more on that later).3. Will I have to change how I use Ethereum?Nope! Ethereum users aren't impacted by the implementation of Shapella, and will be able to transact as they always would. The one difference, of course, will be if you are a solo staker and/or validator. If you are a part of one of those groups you will be able to begin the process of claiming rewards and withdrawing your stake, should you choose to do so (more on that below, too).4. How do withdrawals work? How much ETH can be withdrawn?There is currently more than 18.2M ETH (~576,000 validators) deposited on the Beacon Chain, with an additional 1M of ETH rewards having accrued since staking went live.These two cohorts of ETH have different withdrawal processes. Validator exits (i.e. the 18.2M) undergo a full withdrawal process. Accrued rewards on the other hand, termed partial withdrawals, are eligible for expedited clearing.Full-withdrawals have to go through two queues, withdrawal and exit, which serve as a delay for when a staker signals their intention to withdraw their deposit to when it becomes fully liquid. There is some validator math that goes into calculating this figure, but about 57,000 ETH will become eligible to be withdrawn daily via full withdrawals immediately after Shapella goes live. In the first 54 days following the upgrade, as much as 3.3M ETH can move to exit the Beacon Chain.Partial-withdrawals (i.e. staking rewards) get to bypass these queues, and can become liquid near-instantaneously. Per our analysis, it will take about 4.75 days post-Shapella for this ETH to be withdrawn and liquid.5. Will ETH dump after Shapella?That’s the $230 billion question! As discussed above, the 1M ETH ($1.9B) in accrued staking rewards will become eligible to be withdrawn within 5 days post-Shapella. This represents the first significant chunk of staked ETH supply to hit the open-market, and it’s likely that some portion of this will be sold. If all of it were sold, it would account for about 12% of the ETH’s daily trading volumes. However, the probability of this scenario occurring is very low, as many validators will choose to re-stake within a different venue.After this, factoring in queues and a 27-hour delay after Shapella’s implementation, an estimated 3.3M ETH (worth $6.3B at current prices) will become eligible to be withdrawn in the first 54 days post-upgrade. We don’t know how much of this will be withdrawn and sold, though we’ll be able to monitor these staking flows in real time. But ultimately, this author believes that the impact of Shanghai on the price of ETH in the short-term to be minimal. I expect the vast majority of staked ETH will not be withdrawn. For the ETH that is withdrawn, a significant portion will be re-staked, rather than sold.Furthermore, in the medium to long-term, Shanghai is a “bullish unlock”, as it should lead to more ETH being bought and staked. So far, so good for the bulls - as ETH has rallied 6.1% in the week leading into the news. We’ll see if it continues to hold up.6. What happens to Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs)?Just like transactors, LSD holders will not be largely impacted by Shapella.While some have speculated that there may be changes in their liquidity and potential volatility in their price relative to ETH (i.e. trading above or below 1:1), LSDs will still be freely tradable for other ERC-20s and can continue to be deployed in supported DeFi protocols.LSDs like stETH, rETH, frxETH, and sETH2 will still represent a 1:1 claim on an ETH deposit into their respective protocols. However, not all LSD issuers will initially support withdrawals. For instance, Lido, the largest staking entity on the Beacon Chain with 31.3% market share, will not support stETH withdrawals until “around mid-May” due to pending audits.7. How will LSD governance tokens perform?LSD governance tokens have been among the best performing assets of 2023, with Lido (LDO), Rocket Pool (RPL), and Frax (FXS), soaring between 103-135% against USD and 17-37% against ETH year-to-date.Much of this outperformance has been in anticipation of Shapella, with traders expecting the upgrade to catalyze an influx in deposits into liquid staking protocols.Will this be a “sell the news” event for LSD governance tokens? Or will they continue their outperformance?

In today's newsletter, we dig into the details of the Shanghai + Capella upgrades going live on the network tomorrow.- Bankless teamBankless Writers: Ben Giove and Jack Inabinet It’s Shapella szn!Years in the making, one of the most anticipated network upgrades in Ethereum’s history is here, with the Shapella upgrade set to go live around 6:00 pm EST tomorrow!Shapella represents the final milestone in Ethereum’s multi-year transition from Proof-Of-Work (PoW) to Proof-Of-Stake (PoS) consensus. It will enable Ethereum stakers/validators to withdraw their deposits from the Beacon Chain.The upgrade has significant implications for ETH and the staking landscape. As a result there’s been a torrent of discussion, threads, opinions (and misinformation) around the impact of the event.It’s easy to get lost in the noise - But we’re here to help you cut through it. You’ve got questions, we’ve got answers. Here’s everything you need to know about Shapella.1. Shapella? Wasn’t this called Shanghai?Yes, the community initially rallied around the “Shanghai” moniker for withdrawals. But the more technically correct “Shapella” designation has found a home in crypto vernacular as of late.Shapella = Shanghai + Capella, with the new term referring to the implementation of the change that is occurring at both the network's execution and consensus layers. At the execution layer, Shanghai will create a new transaction type that will allow stakers to withdraw validator balances, while at the consensus layer, Capella will enable the Beacon Chain to accept a withdrawal request.Together, the two will imbue stakers with the ability to withdraw their deposits for the first time in Ethereum’s history.2. Why is there so much hype around Shapella?Shapella marks the completion of Ethereum’s transition to PoS.The first step was the “Merge”, which saw the merging of the Beacon Chain launched in December 2020, with the old PoW Ethereum chain. It went off without a hitch in September 2022. However, until this point, staking has been a one way street. Holders could deposit their ETH into the Beacon Chain and earn rewards, but could not withdraw any funds.Liquid staking derivatives (LSDs) like those from Lido Finance and Rocketpool partially mitigated this illiquidity, by providing liquidity for stakers through the issuance of tradable derivative tokens that represent a claim on their deposit.However, the ETH stake rate sits at just 14.9%. This is well below the 60.1% average for the top 20 PoS networks, and can likely be attributable in large part to both the technical and liquidity risks that currently exist with pre-Shapella ETH staking. This is why many believe that Shapella de-risks ETH staking, with withdrawals enabling an exit for stakers. As a result, it’s likely that Ethereum will undergo a “staking super cycle,” which refers to a surge in staking deposits that takes its stake rate closer to the mean.This expected staking boom has also helped fuel the enthusiasm around LSDs, which are expected to be one of the primary beneficiaries of this growth (more on that later).3. Will I have to change how I use Ethereum?Nope! Ethereum users aren't impacted by the implementation of Shapella, and will be able to transact as they always would. The one difference, of course, will be if you are a solo staker and/or validator. If you are a part of one of those groups you will be able to begin the process of claiming rewards and withdrawing your stake, should you choose to do so (more on that below, too).4. How do withdrawals work? How much ETH can be withdrawn?There is currently more than 18.2M ETH (~576,000 validators) deposited on the Beacon Chain, with an additional 1M of ETH rewards having accrued since staking went live.These two cohorts of ETH have different withdrawal processes. Validator exits (i.e. the 18.2M) undergo a full withdrawal process.

In the first 54 days following the upgrade, as much as 3.3M ETH can move to exit the Beacon Chain.Partial-withdrawals (i.e. staking rewards) get to bypass these queues, and can become liquid near-instantaneously. Per our analysis, it will take about 4.75 days post-Shapella for this ETH to be withdrawn and liquid.5. Will ETH dump after Shapella?That’s the $230 billion question! As discussed above, the 1M ETH ($1.9B) in accrued staking rewards will become eligible to be withdrawn within 5 days post-Shapella. This represents the first significant chunk of staked ETH supply to hit the open-market, and it’s likely that some portion of this will be sold. If all of it were sold, it would account for about 12% of the ETH’s daily trading volumes. However, the probability of this scenario occurring is very low, as many validators will choose to re-stake within a different venue.After this, factoring in queues and a 27-hour delay after Shapella’s implementation, an estimated 3.3M ETH (worth $6.3B at current prices) will become eligible to be withdrawn in the first 54 days post-upgrade. We don’t know how much of this will be withdrawn and sold, though we’ll be able to monitor these staking flows in real time. But ultimately, this author believes that the impact of Shanghai on the price of ETH in the short-term to be minimal. I expect the vast majority of staked ETH will not be withdrawn. For the ETH that is withdrawn, a significant portion will be re-staked, rather than sold.Furthermore, in the medium to long-term, Shanghai is a “bullish unlock”, as it should lead to more ETH being bought and staked. So far, so good for the bulls - as ETH has rallied 6.1% in the week leading into the news. We’ll see if it continues to hold up.6. What happens to Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs)?Just like transactors, LSD holders will not be largely impacted by Shapella.While some have speculated that there may be changes in their liquidity and potential volatility in their price relative to ETH (i.e. trading above or below 1:1), LSDs will still be freely tradable for other ERC-20s and can continue to be deployed in supported DeFi protocols.LSDs like stETH, rETH, frxETH, and sETH2 will still represent a 1:1 claim on an ETH deposit into their respective protocols. However, not all LSD issuers will initially support withdrawals. For instance, Lido, the largest staking entity on the Beacon Chain with 31.3% market share, will not support stETH withdrawals until “around mid-May” due to pending audits.7. How will LSD governance tokens perform?LSD governance tokens have been among the best performing assets of 2023, with Lido (LDO), Rocket Pool (RPL), and Frax (FXS), soaring between 103-135% against USD and 17-37% against ETH year-to-date.Much of this outperformance has been in anticipation of Shapella, with traders expecting the upgrade to catalyze an influx in deposits into liquid staking protocols.Will this be a “sell the news” event for LSD governance tokens?

Today, we take a look at the expectations vs. reality of the Shapella upgrade. - Bankless team Bankless Writers: Ben Giove & Jack Inabinet We now live in a post-Shapella world! One of the largest upgrades in Etheruem’s history officially arrived this week, with Shapella completing Ethereum's transition to Proof-Of-Stake (PoS) by enabling withdrawals from staking. Leading up to the event, there was rampant speculation on how the upgrade would impact the markets, the staking landscape and DeFi. In one corner you had the bulls , who felt that the upgrade represented a significant de-risking event for ETH, believing that the removal of the technical risk around withdrawals would lead to an influx of users who would buy-and-stake.

Let’s dive in.Market ReactionIt’s been under 48 hours since Shapella hit mainnet, but so far it certainly seems to be a “bullish unlock.”ETH has roared since the upgrade went live, surging 13.1% from $1871 to $2117 at the time of writing. This move has left a trail of bear carcasses in its wake, leading to more than $84.7M worth of short liquidations between April 12-13. This is the most we’ve seen in a two-day period since March 12-13, when ETH rallied in the wake of the USDC de-peg and banking crisis.Source: CoinGlassEthereum ecosystem tokens have experienced monster rallies since Shapella, with – unsurprisingly -- staking-related tokens leading the charge.This includes liquid-staking derivative (LSD) governance tokens, with Lido (LDO), Rocket Pool (RPL), Frax (FXS) and StakeWise (SWISE) surging 14.3%, 17.1%, 12.9% and 19.2% respectively at the time of writing. LSD-Fi protocols have also soared, with Pendle (PENDLE) rallying 19.9%, Flashstake (FLASH) ripping 47.1% and unshETH (USH) mooning 56.1%. Layer 2 tokens have also surged on the back of the move in ETH, with Arbitrum (ARB), and Optimism (OP) rallying 30.8% and 18.0%.Source: TradingViewThese monster moves suggest that fears of a post-Shapella dump were overblown. Instead, early signs point towards those in the bullish de-risking camp being in the right, as the upgrade has been treated as a buy-the-news event.Withdrawal ActivityOutflows have overpowered deposits and the Beacon Chain has seen 106k in net Ether outflows since Shapella went live. While the impacts of Shapella are just beginning to be felt, it appears prophecies of catastrophe were overblown.Source: NansenEthereum’s exit queue is live and full of stakers looking to withdraw. At the time of analysis, there was 827k ETH across 23k validators in the queue, representing 4.1% of the validator set.Kraken represents the vast majority of exits (65.9%) as its settlement with the SEC required the shuttering of US staking operations. A majority of these clients (likely proportional to other providers), however, will probably re-stake as the settlement did not alter the underlying benefits of ETH staking.Source: NansenAt the current validator count and given exit queue constraints, a maximum of 1.8k validators can exit per day. All present exit requests can be processed within 14 days from the publication of this article, a far cry from ETH doomers’ calls for months of withdrawals.Bankrupt crypto lender Celsius has 158k staked ETH not included in the exit queue at the time of analysis. The need to liquidate this position to repay creditors means withdrawals are inevitable.All things the same, less Kraken’s withdrawals and inclusive of Celsius’s withdrawals, 2.3% of ETH staked can be expected as net outflows from full withdrawals. Partial withdrawals are the largest source of potential outflows, with 877k in accrued consensus rewards waiting to be automatically withdrawn at the time of analysis.  Nearly 70% of these rewards, however, belong to validators with type 0x00 credentials and cannot be withdrawn until upgraded to type 0x01 credentials. Stakers have been long aware they need to upgrade credentials prior to withdrawing, so it is unlikely we see a significant number of validators upgrade their credentials in the immediate term, limiting staking outflows from partial withdrawals.DeFi ActivitySolo validators and Staking-as-a-Service products gained liquidity on stake, however, for many LSD protocols, absolutely nothing has changed post-Shapella.Liquid-staking heavyweight Lido, for example, will not have withdrawals enabled until May at the earliest, pending deployment to testnet and the completion of several outstanding security audits. An inability to withdraw means outflows from liquid-staking are a non-factor at present. However we currently anticipate larger players like Lido to lose market share to smaller protocols as altruistic stakers move to decentralize network security and new LSD-Fi projects spin up token incentives for their product offerings in the coming months.Coinbase’s staking program, which allows users to mint their cbETH staking derivative, is the exception, with redemptions of over 35.5k cbETH for users following Shapella. Coinbase makes up 10.3% of the exit queue, representing a further 86k in full Ether withdrawals. Included in this calculation, however, is withdrawals for products beyond LSDs, like institutional staking.Source: Dune AnalyticsDeFi borrower demand for liquid-staking derivatives has been virtually non-existent.Aave’s stETH market has continued its downward rate spiral, with utilization hovering slightly under 13%. Lenders are currently earning under 10 bps and borrowers are paying 28 bps on the protocol’s Ethereum V3 market. Lending activity on Compound is similarly depressed, with utilization of the ETH market at 54.6%, well below the targeted 90% utilization kink point, above which borrowing rapidly becomes prohibitively expensive.Total collateral lent to and borrowed from Compound’s ETH market has also fallen precipitously since the start of April, down 33.4% and 34.9%, respectively. Lending and borrowing rates on the platform have plummeted as well, down from 2.21% to 1.46% and 5.01% to 3.65%, respectively, over the same period.LSD stableswap pools have remained relatively… stable, however, we are seeing some early indications of stETH sell pressure, in line with our beliefs that stake will be redistributed from Lido.Balancer’s wstETH/sfrxETH/rETH (41.0% wstETH) and wstETH/cbETH (56.6% wstETH) pools, in addition to Curve’s wETH/stETH concentrated pool (64.5% stETH), are all indicating outsized sell pressure on Lido’s staking derivative. Further evidence for this thesis can be found in stETH’s deviation from peg. Currently, stETH is trading at 0.36% discount, compared to a 0.10% premium for rETH, testing the lower bound established after March’s banking crisis.Source: Dune AnalyticsShould Lido’s competitors be successful at draining its TVL, this results in a near-term steepening of stETH’s discount. Absent withdrawals, the underlying ETH remains illiquid, leaving sale as the sole substitute for redemption. A Busy 48 HoursAs we can see, both the market and on-chain participants have been keeping busy post-Shapella.Prices have surged with ETH rallying above $2100, carrying liquid-staking, LSD-Fi, and L2 tokens along with it. Although early, this rally seems to suggest that the event was a de-risking one, rather than the source of torrential sell pressure that some had feared.We can also see that there have been net-outflows since the upgrade went live, led in large part by CEXs like Kraken and Coinbase.Shapella has also begun to impact the LSD market, with cbETH being hit with more than 35K in redemptions while Lido’s stETH is trading below peg.

Leading up to the event, there was rampant speculation on how the upgrade would impact the markets, the staking landscape and DeFi.In one corner you had the bulls, who felt that the upgrade represented a significant de-risking event for ETH, believing that the removal of the technical risk around withdrawals would lead to an influx of users who would buy-and-stake.In the other camp, you had the bears, who thought that Shapella represented a major supply overhang for ETH, believing that mass withdrawals would lead to persistent sell pressure on the asset.Who was right? Let’s dive in.Market ReactionIt’s been under 48 hours since Shapella hit mainnet, but so far it certainly seems to be a “bullish unlock.”ETH has roared since the upgrade went live, surging 13.1% from $1871 to $2117 at the time of writing. This move has left a trail of bear carcasses in its wake, leading to more than $84.7M worth of short liquidations between April 12-13. This is the most we’ve seen in a two-day period since March 12-13, when ETH rallied in the wake of the USDC de-peg and banking crisis.Source: CoinGlassEthereum ecosystem tokens have experienced monster rallies since Shapella, with – unsurprisingly -- staking-related tokens leading the charge.This includes liquid-staking derivative (LSD) governance tokens, with Lido (LDO), Rocket Pool (RPL), Frax (FXS) and StakeWise (SWISE) surging 14.3%, 17.1%, 12.9% and 19.2% respectively at the time of writing. LSD-Fi protocols have also soared, with Pendle (PENDLE) rallying 19.9%, Flashstake (FLASH) ripping 47.1% and unshETH (USH) mooning 56.1%. Layer 2 tokens have also surged on the back of the move in ETH, with Arbitrum (ARB), and Optimism (OP) rallying 30.8% and 18.0%.Source: TradingViewThese monster moves suggest that fears of a post-Shapella dump were overblown. Instead, early signs point towards those in the bullish de-risking camp being in the right, as the upgrade has been treated as a buy-the-news event.Withdrawal ActivityOutflows have overpowered deposits and the Beacon Chain has seen 106k in net Ether outflows since Shapella went live. While the impacts of Shapella are just beginning to be felt, it appears prophecies of catastrophe were overblown.Source: NansenEthereum’s exit queue is live and full of stakers looking to withdraw. At the time of analysis, there was 827k ETH across 23k validators in the queue, representing 4.1% of the validator set.Kraken represents the vast majority of exits (65.9%) as its settlement with the SEC required the shuttering of US staking operations. A majority of these clients (likely proportional to other providers), however, will probably re-stake as the settlement did not alter the underlying benefits of ETH staking.Source: NansenAt the current validator count and given exit queue constraints, a maximum of 1.8k validators can exit per day. All present exit requests can be processed within 14 days from the publication of this article, a far cry from ETH doomers’ calls for months of withdrawals.Bankrupt crypto lender Celsius has 158k staked ETH not included in the exit queue at the time of analysis. The need to liquidate this position to repay creditors means withdrawals are inevitable.All things the same, less Kraken’s withdrawals and inclusive of Celsius’s withdrawals, 2.3% of ETH staked can be expected as net outflows from full withdrawals. Partial withdrawals are the largest source of potential outflows, with 877k in accrued consensus rewards waiting to be automatically withdrawn at the time of analysis.  Nearly 70% of these rewards, however, belong to validators with type 0x00 credentials and cannot be withdrawn until upgraded to type 0x01 credentials. Stakers have been long aware they need to upgrade credentials prior to withdrawing, so it is unlikely we see a significant number of validators upgrade their credentials in the immediate term, limiting staking outflows from partial withdrawals.DeFi ActivitySolo validators and Staking-as-a-Service products gained liquidity on stake, however, for many LSD protocols, absolutely nothing has changed post-Shapella.Liquid-staking heavyweight Lido, for example, will not have withdrawals enabled until May at the earliest, pending deployment to testnet and the completion of several outstanding security audits. An inability to withdraw means outflows from liquid-staking are a non-factor at present. However we currently anticipate larger players like Lido to lose market share to smaller protocols as altruistic stakers move to decentralize network security and new LSD-Fi projects spin up token incentives for their product offerings in the coming months.Coinbase’s staking program, which allows users to mint their cbETH staking derivative, is the exception, with redemptions of over 35.5k cbETH for users following Shapella. Coinbase makes up 10.3% of the exit queue, representing a further 86k in full Ether withdrawals. Included in this calculation, however, is withdrawals for products beyond LSDs, like institutional staking.Source: Dune AnalyticsDeFi borrower demand for liquid-staking derivatives has been virtually non-existent.Aave’s stETH market has continued its downward rate spiral, with utilization hovering slightly under 13%. Lenders are currently earning under 10 bps and borrowers are paying 28 bps on the protocol’s Ethereum V3 market. Lending activity on Compound is similarly depressed, with utilization of the ETH market at 54.6%, well below the targeted 90% utilization kink point, above which borrowing rapidly becomes prohibitively expensive.Total collateral lent to and borrowed from Compound’s ETH market has also fallen precipitously since the start of April, down 33.4% and 34.9%, respectively. Lending and borrowing rates on the platform have plummeted as well, down from 2.21% to 1.46% and 5.01% to 3.65%, respectively, over the same period.LSD stableswap pools have remained relatively… stable, however, we are seeing some early indications of stETH sell pressure, in line with our beliefs that stake will be redistributed from Lido.Balancer’s wstETH/sfrxETH/rETH (41.0% wstETH) and wstETH/cbETH (56.6% wstETH) pools, in addition to Curve’s wETH/stETH concentrated pool (64.5% stETH), are all indicating outsized sell pressure on Lido’s staking derivative.

Ethereum withdrawals enabledEthereum is finally proof-of-stake. “Shapella”, Ethereum’s biggest network upgrade since the Merge last October, took place this week.With that, any validators or users staking ETH directly on the Beacon chain can finally start making their withdrawals. If you’re just catching up on this momentous upgrade, read our Everything You Need to Know About Shapella article or watch the Bankless pod with Tim Beiko, Justin Drake and Anthony Sassano.Proof-of-stake took a bit of time, but the loop is finally complete!

Happy Shapella, Happy withdrawals
Congrats— dannyryan (@dannyryan) April 12, 2023

As of Saturday, a total of 332K ETH has been withdrawn out of the 18M locked ETH. Despite mass withdrawal fears, 103K ETH has also been staked onto Ethereum in the last 24 hours. For a full look into the post-market action of this historic network upgrade, read our post-Shapella analysis.Binance announced that staked ETH withdrawals on its exchange would be enabled on April 19 at 8AM UTC time.3. MEV exploit dramaStablecoin centralization risks are again in the news this week as Tether blacklisted $3 million of USDT belonging to the address of a MEV bot, due to pressure from law enforcement agencies.The MEV bot in question, called the Sandwich Exploiter, made headlines last week when it snagged a whopping $25.4 million from other MEV bots by exploiting a bug in the Flashbots MEV-Boost relay.Polygon co-founder Jaynti Kanani is calling this move by Tether “a bad precedent.” bloXroutelabs CEO Uri Klarman agrees, and argued that the “exploiter did exactly what a sandwich bot would do.” Fastlane Labs co-founder Thogard has labeled this case of Tether exercising control over the consensus layer of Ethereum “the most concerning DeFi development of 2023.”Sandwich Exploiter moved their USDC out of their main wallet due to @zachxbt message🤝

Then supplied USDC to AAVE + Compound. Sent the ""lent"" USDC deposits back to exploit wallet

Most likely to circumvent USDC blacklist as Circle would have to blacklist all ""lent"" USDC deposits pic.twitter.com/zXf9UDJ1HY— Umbrella (@umbrella_uni) April 10, 2023

Whether or not the action by Tether is justifiable all depends on what one considers the inviolable rules at the Ethereum protocol layer. After all, Tether already blacklists addresses of DeFi hackers, which is generally accepted by the community, but the MEV exploiter's victims were not everyday retail users but professional MEV arbitrageurs. Fearing similar action from Circle, the MEV exploiter has tried to circumvent a potential ban by lending their USDC to DeFi lending platforms Aave and Compound and co-mingling the USDC with other loans.4. FTX born again?They say time heals all wounds, and thanks to rising crypto prices, Reuters reports that FTX’s recovered funds are now valued at $7.3 billion, up from $6.2 billion since November. At the time of its collapse, FTX owed its top 50 creditors an estimated $3 billion.There’s also talk of the exchange relaunching in Q2. FTX attorney Andy Dietderich notes, “FTX is negotiating with stakeholders about options for restarting its crypto exchange, and it may make a decision on that in the current quarter.”Separately in CEX land, the Winklevoss twins are also reportedly dipping into their own piggy banks for a $100 million loan to their own exchange. Gemini was hit by Genesis's bankruptcy last year when $900 million of customer funds on its “Earn” investment product was frozen.5. Yearn Finance V1 hackedAn old version of DeFi aggregator Yearn Finance was hacked on Thursday for $11.6 million. The exploit stemmed from a code vulnerability in yUSDT, the protocol’s yield-accruing token that mirrors the value of Tether’s USDT.According to samczsun, Yearn’s code erroneously used Fulcrum’s iUSDC token rather than the iUSDT token, allowing the hackers to mint 1.2 quadrillion yUSDT, then cash out millions worth of stablecoins. Fulcrum is a lesser-known DeFi lending platform. Yearn Finance V2 was not impacted..@iearnfinance was just hacked for over $10M.

Today, we dig deeper into Distributed Validator Technology (DVT), an exciting breakthrough for the staking scene. - Bankless team Bankless Writer: Ben Giove Ever since the Shapella network upgrade went live on April 12, the attention of crypto has been on the inflows and outflows from the Beacon Chain. But Ethereum’s staking landscape is still evolving . There are a plethora of other exciting infrastructure and application layer innovations that are poised to further shake up the ETH staking economy. The most prominent example is Distributed Validator Technology (DVT), a protocol that aims to make staking easier and more accessible through the creation of a “multi-sig for validators.” DVT uses a smorgasbord of complex cryptographic techniques – distributed key generation, Shamir’s Secret Sharing, threshold signing, multi-party computation – to split control over a single private key among a group of different validators. (DVT is complex and explaining its technical intricacies goes beyond the scope of this piece. If you’d like to read more about how it works under the hood, see here.) This means that a single validator can be ""shared"", by running on multiple machines in different locations by different entities. DVT is not a proof-of-concept – it’s here . The two leading solutions are by Obol and SSV, and are progressing towards being fully implemented in production. The former entered its mainnet “Alpha Release” on April 20, while the latter launched its final testnet, JATO on March 30. Intrigued? If so, let’s take a closer look into DVT by exploring: What benefits the technology provides The implications it will have on the staking landscape Let’s dive in! 👇","Dear Bankless Nation,We've been serving you up with plenty of post-Shapella markets content, but what's next for staking?

If so, let’s take a closer look into DVT by exploring:What benefits the technology providesThe implications it will have on the staking landscapeLet’s dive in! 👇What are the benefits of DVT?The primary benefit that DVT provides is a reduced risk of slashing.Slashing refers to a penalty incurred by validators, in the form of losing a portion of their stake, for not properly abiding by the rules of consensus. Slashing serves as an economic incentive for validators to play by the rules and not attempt any sort of malicious attack. Routine events, such as a validator going offline as a result of a power outage or experiencing downtime as a result of technical issues, can also trigger a slashing penalty.Unintentional slashing events can have numerous downstream effects, such as potentially helping concentrate stake in large pools or protocols that are less vulnerable to these events at the expense of smaller pools or solo stakers. DVT fixes this by providing redundancy and removing single points of validator failure. Under a DVT network, a validator that goes offline does not incur a slashing penalty as there will be numerous other instances in which their validator is still operational. This not only mitigates stake concentration by increasing returns for solo (and squad) stakers, it also increases the resilience of Ethereum as a whole (or other PoS chains that implement it in the future). Widespread adoption of DVT creates a more robust network that is less vulnerable to mass slashing events.This is because with DVT, validators of all ilk can have their local machine be taken offline while still retaining uptime. As a result, this should increase their staking yields through being able to produce more blocks as well as enduring significantly smaller slashing events.How will this affect the Ethereum staking landscape?
👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Squad StakingWe’ve already touched on how DVT will impact solo staking, but let’s dive in a bit further.Many solo stakers are at a disadvantage relative to professional stakers, as it is more difficult and expensive for an individual to create a robust and resilient staking setup relative to a well capitalized company. This in turn, gives professionals, and large staking pools, a notable competitive advantage. DVT should help close this gap, decreasing the delta between the yield earned by professional validators and by solo stakers.But, DVT should also help unlock what’s known as squad staking. Squad staking refers to small groups of solo validators that are staking together.'Squad staking' will be a big theme for ETH staking going forward

Individuals with less than 32 ETH each can pool their assets together and run distributed validator technology on their own hardware in order to become a full validator

Decentralized staking takes many forms!— sassal.eth 🦇🔊 (@sassal0x) April 14, 2023

DVT helps enable a kind of group staking to be carried out in a trust minimized, secure fashion. For example, DVT can enable a group of friends who live all across the world, and may not have 32 ETH individually, to pool their funds and validate under one, robust system with reduced slashing risks.This, coupled with modular liquid staking protocols such as Lido V2, StakeWise V3, and Stader (which I’ll touch on more below), could help top-notch squad stakers attract outside capital and compete with professional validator firms.💧 Liquid StakingDVT is set to play a major role in liquid staking.Protocols like Lido have begun testing the technology, having run pilot programs with SSV and Obol on testnet. It should also play a big role in Lido V2, which will enable isolated groups of validators, known as modules, to integrate DVT.Other staking protocols, such as Rocket Pool, will also be able to utilize DVT. Some on the rETH issuers governance forum have even speculated that it could enable the protocol to support zero ETH bonds for minipools rather than the 8 ETH one that is required today (though it’s worth noting that this is hypothetical).StakeWise V3 should also fit hand-in-glove with DVT, as individual vaults on the platform will be able to easily plug into networks like Obol and SSV, while other staking solutions such as Diva are creating their own DVT solution, which may serve to differentiate them in an increasingly competitive LSD market.As we can see, all signs point to widespread interest in utilizing DVT. In fact, should the technology become widely adopted due to its risk mitigation properties, use of DVT may become a prerequisite among LSD issuers who are hoping to attract any meaningful amount of stake.📈 Market ImpactOf course, the adoption of DVT will also have an impact on the markets, and presents opportunities for investors and airdrop farmers alike.For starters, it should help buoy yields for stakers by reducing the number of slashing instances (at least on the margin). All things the same, this should increase the attractiveness of staking ETH, and in the long-run, help drive inflows into liquid staking protocols that support DVT.Currently, the only tokenized DVT protocol is SSV, (whose token symbol also happens to be SSV). SSV is used for governance, as well as payments and collateral within the network. The project recently announced a $50M ecosystem fund to help spur adoption of DVT within the Ethereum ecosystem, and currently trades at an FDV of $299.1M. SSV is unique in that it is a “pick and shovel” staking play. This is because rather than have to bet on the success of one staking provider, SSV instead provides an exposure to all that incorporate it.Obol has not confirmed whether they will launch a token, but given that they have raised $19M in total venture funding, it’s likely they will release one in the future as early backers look to realize their investment. This should likely present an interesting airdrop opportunity for early validators on the network.ConclusionAs we can see, Shapella is not the only noteworthy thing happening in the world of staking.DVT is another exciting development, representing a promising technology that can improve the resilience of Ethereum and the accessibility of solo staking while also unlocking new groups of stakeholders (pun intended) such as squad stakers.Although DVT has yet to be fully implemented, the two leading solutions, Obol and SSV, are progressing towards a full rollout and have seen interest from an assortment of major liquid staking protocols.DVT szn is coming.

“You take your staked ETH… and you stake it again”It’s overly reductive, but it’s right. This simple explanation illustrates why ‘restaking’ is so powerful. “You stake it again? What for? Into what? How? Why?”The answer is yes. Restaking lets you stake your already-staked ETH, for any purpose.If you’re familiar with the older idea of PoW ""Merge Mining”, you can start there as a general concept. Merge mining is where multiple networks can be mined at the same time, using the same “work”. The hashing power from one mining rig is shared between two or more blockchains that have compatible PoW algorithms. One mining rig mining on two blockchains, generating two different sources of revenue.Applying this to Proof of Stake, restaking is when multiple networks are secured at the same time, using the same capital stake. You stake your ETH to the Beacon Chain, and you’ve given the Beacon Chain the authority to ""slash"" your ETH if you are malicious to the network. Then, you take your staked ETH and sign up for additional slashing conditions from a different network that you also want to stake for. For example, you could build an oracle network on top of EigenLayer, where you get your ETH slashed for providing bad data to Ethereum, but also rewarded for providing good data.Same ETH, different network, new slashing conditions, more rewards.Impacts and risks on Ethereum securityRestaking has caused concern among some Ethereum protocol devs. Just like with MEV, restaking generates some very significant questions about the long-term health of the Ethereum network. Restaking calls the alignment of ETH stakers into question. Before restaking, ETH stakers only served one network: Ethereum. ETH is staked to Ethereum – and Ethereum alone.Restaking lets ETH stakers go from Ethereum monogamy to network polyamory. What was once previously a source of committed security to Ethereum now has the option to also commit security to other networks.Is the health of the Ethereum network at risk if too many ETH stakers become ETH restakers? If ETH stakers are also securing other networks with their ETH, Ethereum security is clearly being diluted as a result.  While trying to understand the risks and benefits associated with restaking, I came up with a little comparison to Skyrim mods (or modding in general).Mods are community-generated changes that enhance or alter a title in some way. The actual game studio provides the ‘base game’ (with years of development costs), and then hobbyists and enthusiasts build off the base game’s network effects with modifications they think are useful and enjoyable.The biggest Skyrim mods are massive open-source projects that are hardened and robust pieces of code. For example:Unofficial Skyrim Patch - Fixes every major bug left by the core Skyrim devsNew Idles - New animations and movement patterns for players and NPCsSkyUI - A huge UI upgrade; inventory management, skill tree navigation, etc.These mods have been downloaded millions of times, and have undergone their own series of updates, patches, and fixes from open-source contributors. They are good pieces of code, and they’re safe to install on top of the base game. The problem with mods is that they’re addicting. The “blue chips” of Skyrim are safe, but there’s the insatiable user desire to always test new boundaries. The more esoteric mods you install, the higher the chances there are of something going wrong. Once you're on the 41st page of the mods library and you’ve found yourself installing “My Little Pony Weapons and Armour” along with “Guards Are Chickens” mods, you know you’re in for a hairball of loading contingencies and conflicts.It’s okay when the costs of mod conflicts are simply crashing the game. The result is a frustrating afternoon. But when we extend this pattern to restaking, it's our ETH and Ethereum’s security that’s at stake.We call them ‘Degens’ for a reason - it's too easy to imagine restakers staking their ETH into as many protocols as possible, trying to juice their yields to maximize their returns. In crypto, that behavior is table stakes.Pseudo-enshrinementSticking with the mods metaphor, the top mods to titles like Skyrim can often be considered as ‘enshrined mods’ - they provide such a fundamental enhancement to the game that it's kind of crazy to not install them. There’s only upside.In Ethereum researchland, there’s the concept of ‘enshrined rollups’ or ‘enshrined oracles’, in which a rollup or oracle is built directly into the core Ethereum protocol itself. Consider it 'state-sponsored infrastructure' that benefits from being a first-class citizen compared to others. This can be dangerous too, as it impacts credible neutrality and adds additional risks, which is why you don’t see anything like that in Ethereum currently.Restaking could create unique situations where large networks garner so much adoption that more than 50% of all staked ETH is restaked to them. In these cases, these networks could effectively become enshrined pieces of Ethereum infrastructure without any EIP to formalize them as such.Is restaking pseudo-enshrinement an attack-vector for Ethereum?Should we be worried about this future? Have networks like Chainlink already created this relationship? Would a restaked oracle network be more aligned to Ethereum than Chainlink?There are a lot of open questions here.Cementing ETH as the internet’s native currencyWhile it raises a lot of questions, restaking and the idea of an infinitely moddable security layer on the internet is really bullish for ETH.This is because EigenLayer opens up a near-infinite amount of utility for ETH and ETH staking. Entirely new networks can be birthed on top of ETH as a security layer. Bootstrapping a network is hard, but with EigenLayer, new networks are able to tap into a pre-existing $35B of security by commoditizing ETH staking into generalizable security for new networks.In crypto, there’s a pendulum between the trends of spawning new L1s and building on pre-existing networks. We watched this play out in Bitcoin in 2017, where some projects chose to fork Bitcoin – ‘airdropping’ new network tokens to BTC holders, versus bootstrapping a new network from scratch (either a new L1, or an ICO on Ethereum).EigenLayer shifts the incentive-pendulum from the poly-L1 side to a single-shared-network based on ETH. EigenLayer is a downstream conclusion of the idea that capital-begets-capital. ETH and ETH validators are the largest pool of crypto-economic security in the world. In theory, EigenLayer doesn’t care what network it integrates with, but it's incentivized to choose the largest source of economic security in existence - ETH and staked ETH.EigenLayer lets entirely new kinds of networks be born out of the security of ETH stakers, and the value of these networks ultimately flows down into ETH staking yields, both increasing the incentive to stake ETH and the value of the ETH principle. Each new network is a new bond market of varying degrees of productivity and yield, and each new network is layered upon the highest order form of money in the system: non-restaked ETH.If the incentives behind EigenLayer and restaking are successful, does ETH become cemented as the internet-native bond? Restaking gives ETH a route to emulate the TradBond world: United States Treasuries as a means of final settlement (only one level higher than hard cash or central bank deposits) and then all other forms of bonds (corporate bonds, municipal bonds, junk bonds etc.) are simply higher-order expressions of base money.Restaking as network-bootstrappingEigenLayer democratizes access to bootstrapping a network. It reduces the barrier to starting a network by commoditizing the economic security provided by ETH into a generally available product. How will this impact the incentives behind network-bootstrapping?Since the capital costs of security are lowered, does this open up new venues for capital-raising and network distribution? The ‘long tail’ of networks that find it difficult to raise VC money can simply find network security from EigenLayer instead, and ETH stakers who chose to be early network restakers could access the early upside in lieu of VC financing.Here’s how I see EigenLayer providing an alternative route for network-bootstrapping:Some developers decide to spawn a new network using Eigen-security.They build a network, launch a mainnet, and open the doors for stakers to restake to their network.The network grows from development improvements, restaking security, and ultimately from actual utility and consumption of the network's product (whatever that may be).Eventually, it comes time for the network to leave the nest, and “graduate” from Ethereum. The network retroactively issues a token to restakers as thanks for providing early security while the network was young and needed nurturing.Now the network has its own native token, and it's in the hands of those who have provided real proven value to the network. First, the network sourced security from ETH restakers, and then it gave those security providers its token, which is the new form of network security. So, the role of airdrop recipients never changes, only the asset that provided security is changed.Restakers aren’t paying developer salaries or marketing costs so there still may be outside capital needs, but restaking does change the power dynamics as early networks can more easily tap into alternative sources of capital for growing a critical part of their network.The Restaking MetaEigenLayer has exposed an entirely new design space for building and bootstrapping crypto-networks. I think we can expect all the same patterns of behaviors we’ve seen countless times in crypto: early experimentation, followed by proofs of concepts, then in-production networks… followed by copycats, fervor, and finally overinvestment.It’s important to note how early we are in the entire conversation around what restaking is, and how it impacts the long-term equilibrium of the industry. We mostly don’t know what the future of restaking looks like. The questions posed in this piece are only the tip of the iceberg - they’re meant to produce further conversations and inspiration about what potential the restaking meta holds.But, that’s the fun of the journey, and there’s bound to be opportunity to discover along the way!Action steps:📺 Watch the Bankless podcast on The State of EigenLayer with Sreeram Kannan",https://www.bankless.com/why-eigenlayer-excites-us,2023-05-04T00:00:00.000Z,https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/2023/05/NL_May_3_23-3.jpg,David Hoffman,Bankless,blog,Unknown Error,

🌝 BRC-20s MoonThe total market cap of BRC-20s has soared over the past several weeks, exploding 3441% from $17.5M on April 25 to $619.7M on May 9. Many individual BRC-20s have experienced parabolic runs in conjunction with this move.ORDI/USD - Source: brc-20.ioFor instance, ORDI, the first and largest BRC-20 with a market-cap of $434M has mooned 2357% during this period from $0.75 to $18.43. Since April 2, ORDI has surged an astounding 18,330% and has begun to be listed on centralized exchanges like Gate.io.Other BRC-20s have delivered similarly exponential returns for holders. Tokens like PEPE, MEME, and MOON have all rallied more than 2000% over the past month.🚘 BTC Rush HourThe BRC-20 frenzy has caused chaos in the Bitcoin fee markets.BTC fees have reached their highest levels since April 2021, with the average fee per transaction spiking, currently at roughly $31.Average BTC Transaction Fee - Source: BitInfoChartsIn total, Bitcoin has generated more than $49M in transaction fees over the past week as the BRC-20 craze has intensified. Between that and blockspace rewards, miners have generated more than $204M in revenue during this period.For reference, this weekly revenue is the highest since May 2022.This surge in demand for blockspace has led to massive congestion on the network. There are currently more than 411,000 pending transactions in the mempool.Congestion has also had ramifications in the centralized crypto universe. Binance was forced to halt withdrawals on two separate occasions between May 6-7, and is now prioritizing implementation of Lightning withdrawals to provide alternative escape routes for users.👮 Fun PoliceSpeculators are busy throwing it all on red at the meme casino, meanwhile, individuals who had adopted crypto systems for real world use – particularly those in Latin America, Africa, and Asia – must now compete against these degens for blockspace.I’m in El Salvador 🇸🇻 right now.

Providing both an alternative store of value to inflationary local currencies and financial services for the unbanked have long been two of Bitcoin’s most potent value propositions. Spiking transaction fees pose a major hurdle to adoption among fee-sensitive individuals with lower incomes – the group standing to benefit the most from alternative currencies and financial systems.Activists are decrying the BRC-20 craze as the root cause of congestion, and some observers have gone as far as to claim that BRC-20 adoption is akin to a DDoS attack on the Bitcoin network.Can anyone explain how I'm going to onboard people with these fees? 
Can't use on-chain, can't open channels.

While it's certainly unfortunate that Bitcoin fees have reached elevated levels limiting certain users' ability to transact on-chain, this is the reality of publicly available, commoditized blockspace. These transactions, as stupid and meaningless as they may appear to some, are perfectly valid uses of Bitcoin blockspace.gn

Blockchains have yet to see significant adoption and the notion that the future of consumer finance is carried out on the Layer-1 base is laughable. Layer-1 networks alone, be it Bitcoin or Ethereum, will not provide enough blockspace to obtain scale required by the next generation of financial primitives.Rather than fight against present fee increases (a relatively minor blip when considering exponential increases in future adoption) by attacking specific use cases, we must instead focus our attention on establishing credibly decentralized scaling solutions to handle the load.📉Familiar FateLike their Ethereum-based memecoin cousins, demand for BRC-20s will be fleeting over the long term. Their price will not be an upwards grind, but rather a series of blow-off tops: these instruments are not for investment!They have no value, beyond what can be generated on the memetic layer, and while BRC-20s have existed for two months, these fungible Bitcoin ecosystem tokens required cross-chain meme fervor to attract significant attention. While we have witnessed the explosive growth of memecoins past, they always come back to orbit, scorching top buyers upon re-entry.Although you may be tempted to ape into some of the more explosive-sounding tickers, be aware: you may incur losses up to the value of your investment. Allocate appropriately, as these tokens are both valueless and operate on a novel spec!The Bottom LineBRC-20s likely fail to facilitate any meaningful crypto progress, yet represent a powerful thought experiment utilizing ordinal theory that highlights the role culture plays in the crypto financial system.The presence of painfully high gas fees (already at levels unsustainable for crypto adoption in developing nations, despite extremely limited usage of crypto financial systems today) should serve as a glaring reminder of inability for contemporary blockchain systems to meet future demand and provide additional awareness to the need for decentralized scaling solutions.While memes may come and go, creating demand for blockspace is crucial to ensure the continued security of the network. This holds especially true for the Bitcoin network, where miners will become increasingly dependent on transaction fee revenue to cover costs from operations, as block incentives decrease with successive halvings.Action Steps:📖 Read Nic Carter's take on BRC-20s📚 Read The BRC-20 Boom in Metaversal",https://www.bankless.com/are-btc-memecoins-a-thing-now,,https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/2023/05/NL_May_10_23-2.jpg,Jack Inabinet,Bankless,blog,Unknown Error,

Providing both an alternative store of value to inflationary local currencies and financial services for the unbanked have long been two of Bitcoin’s most potent value propositions. Spiking transaction fees pose a major hurdle to adoption among fee-sensitive individuals with lower incomes – the group standing to benefit the most from alternative currencies and financial systems.Activists are decrying the BRC-20 craze as the root cause of congestion, and some observers have gone as far as to claim that BRC-20 adoption is akin to a DDoS attack on the Bitcoin network.Can anyone explain how I'm going to onboard people with these fees?

Blockchains have yet to see significant adoption and the notion that the future of consumer finance is carried out on the Layer-1 base is laughable. Layer-1 networks alone, be it Bitcoin or Ethereum, will not provide enough blockspace to obtain scale required by the next generation of financial primitives.Rather than fight against present fee increases (a relatively minor blip when considering exponential increases in future adoption) by attacking specific use cases, we must instead focus our attention on establishing credibly decentralized scaling solutions to handle the load.📉Familiar FateLike their Ethereum-based memecoin cousins, demand for BRC-20s will be fleeting over the long term.

🌝 BRC-20s MoonThe total market cap of BRC-20s has soared over the past several weeks, exploding 3441% from $17.5M on April 25 to $619.7M on May 9. Many individual BRC-20s have experienced parabolic runs in conjunction with this move.ORDI/USD - Source: brc-20.ioFor instance, ORDI, the first and largest BRC-20 with a market-cap of $434M has mooned 2357% during this period from $0.75 to $18.43. Since April 2, ORDI has surged an astounding 18,330% and has begun to be listed on centralized exchanges like Gate.io.Other BRC-20s have delivered similarly exponential returns for holders. Tokens like PEPE, MEME, and MOON have all rallied more than 2000% over the past month.🚘 BTC Rush HourThe BRC-20 frenzy has caused chaos in the Bitcoin fee markets.BTC fees have reached their highest levels since April 2021, with the average fee per transaction spiking, currently at roughly $31.Average BTC Transaction Fee - Source: BitInfoChartsIn total, Bitcoin has generated more than $49M in transaction fees over the past week as the BRC-20 craze has intensified. Between that and blockspace rewards, miners have generated more than $204M in revenue during this period.For reference, this weekly revenue is the highest since May 2022.This surge in demand for blockspace has led to massive congestion on the network. There are currently more than 411,000 pending transactions in the mempool.Congestion has also had ramifications in the centralized crypto universe. Binance was forced to halt withdrawals on two separate occasions between May 6-7, and is now prioritizing implementation of Lightning withdrawals to provide alternative escape routes for users.👮 Fun PoliceSpeculators are busy throwing it all on red at the meme casino, meanwhile, individuals who had adopted crypto systems for real world use – particularly those in Latin America, Africa, and Asia – must now compete against these degens for blockspace.I’m in El Salvador 🇸🇻 right now. Just witnessed a cash withdrawal via #btc

Providing both an alternative store of value to inflationary local currencies and financial services for the unbanked have long been two of Bitcoin’s most potent value propositions. Spiking transaction fees pose a major hurdle to adoption among fee-sensitive individuals with lower incomes – the group standing to benefit the most from alternative currencies and financial systems.Activists are decrying the BRC-20 craze as the root cause of congestion, and some observers have gone as far as to claim that BRC-20 adoption is akin to a DDoS attack on the Bitcoin network.Can anyone explain how I'm going to onboard people with these fees? 
Can't use on-chain, can't open channels.
Makes custodial Lightning the only option.
And all that because some people think it's fun to ""break Bitcoin"". Why not use Liquid or RSK? https://t.co/luuqLoNN7d— Anita ⚡🏳️‍🌈 Bitcoin for Fairness (@AnitaPosch) May 8, 2023

While it's certainly unfortunate that Bitcoin fees have reached elevated levels limiting certain users' ability to transact on-chain, this is the reality of publicly available, commoditized blockspace. These transactions, as stupid and meaningless as they may appear to some, are perfectly valid uses of Bitcoin blockspace.gn 

what happened today was the emergence of the brc-20 asset class 

it wasn’t an attack, it wasn’t a ddos 

taproot has just made it simple to productize the bitcoin blockspace into any arbitrary protocol

shitcoin trading protocols is an obvious buyer of that blockspace pic.twitter.com/KdAwWLCUEO— Eric Wall 🧙‍♂️ Taproot Wizard #2 (@ercwl) May 8, 2023

Blockchains have yet to see significant adoption and the notion that the future of consumer finance is carried out on the Layer-1 base is laughable. Layer-1 networks alone, be it Bitcoin or Ethereum, will not provide enough blockspace to obtain scale required by the next generation of financial primitives.Rather than fight against present fee increases (a relatively minor blip when considering exponential increases in future adoption) by attacking specific use cases, we must instead focus our attention on establishing credibly decentralized scaling solutions to handle the load.📉Familiar FateLike their Ethereum-based memecoin cousins, demand for BRC-20s will be fleeting over the long term. Their price will not be an upwards grind, but rather a series of blow-off tops: these instruments are not for investment!They have no value, beyond what can be generated on the memetic layer, and while BRC-20s have existed for two months, these fungible Bitcoin ecosystem tokens required cross-chain meme fervor to attract significant attention. While we have witnessed the explosive growth of memecoins past, they always come back to orbit, scorching top buyers upon re-entry.Although you may be tempted to ape into some of the more explosive-sounding tickers, be aware: you may incur losses up to the value of your investment. Allocate appropriately, as these tokens are both valueless and operate on a novel spec!The Bottom LineBRC-20s likely fail to facilitate any meaningful crypto progress, yet represent a powerful thought experiment utilizing ordinal theory that highlights the role culture plays in the crypto financial system.The presence of painfully high gas fees (already at levels unsustainable for crypto adoption in developing nations, despite extremely limited usage of crypto financial systems today) should serve as a glaring reminder of inability for contemporary blockchain systems to meet future demand and provide additional awareness to the need for decentralized scaling solutions.While memes may come and go, creating demand for blockspace is crucial to ensure the continued security of the network. This holds especially true for the Bitcoin network, where miners will become increasingly dependent on transaction fee revenue to cover costs from operations, as block incentives decrease with successive halvings.Action Steps:📖 Read Nic Carter's take on BRC-20s📚 Read The BRC-20 Boom in Metaversal",https://www.bankless.com/are-btc-memecoins-a-thing-now,,https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/2023/05/NL_May_10_23-2.jpg,Jack Inabinet,Bankless,blog,Unknown Error,

Since Shapella, Lido’s market share has increased from 31.4% to 31.6% – a testament to the fact that the protocol has transformed its past success into a self-perpetuating prophecy of future dominance.Lido derives these ongoing advantages from the native superiority of its ETH staking derivative and the deepening ability to undercut competitor’s fee structures.Token AdvantagesHODLers of stETH benefit from the token’s deep liquidity – making it one of the only viable liquid staking options for whales – with widespread collateral integrations across DeFi increasing the use cases of the token.Because stETH possesses certain qualities that make it more attractive to hold than your average LSD, capital – especially sophisticated capital seeking out the best possible combination of investment attributes – will continue to pour into the token, further solidifying the qualities that make Lido’s staking derivative superior to the rest.Fee StructureCurrently, Lido offers the lowest fees of any bluechip staking provider, meaning that financial incentives are actively pushing stakers towards Lido!The gap between Lido and its closest competitors will only grow overtime as Lido continues to decrease its share of staking rewards, undercutting competitors while juicing profits as more stakers flock to Lido to take advantage of what they see as an increasingly lucrative staking opportunity.Clear parallels to Lido exist in the TradFi world.Vanguard revolutionized the world of investing in the 1980s with low-cost passive indexing giants, continually undercutting competitors' fees in a race to the bottom, and has been able to maintain their edge for nearly half a century. Lido is taking a page directly from this playbook!⚔️ Disrupt LidoLido governance has displayed clear indifference towards the existential threat that its climbing stake accumulation poses, overwhelmingly voting against self-limiting deposits in June 2022.At first glance, it appears doing such would go against the best interests of LDO token holders and harm Lido’s profitability, however, it is also clear that consequences of failing to self-limit are very real. via TwitterSupport is growing among Etherians to reign in Lido, with some arguing that the community should forcibly clean up their act if they refuse to self-limit. While concerning, it is unlikely we see such controls implemented at the base layer, as this would require a hard fork, which risks fracturing the fragile social consensus layer of Ethereum and likely results in a highly undesirable chain split.The Lido community should be concerned by the prospect that its stake centralization translates to dampened future demand for Ethereum blockspace.The protocol is nearing the first of three key thresholds at which core properties of Ethereum’s value proposition are degraded, offering would-be attackers increased powers over the chain. Should Lido continue to grow at an unchecked pace, it will inevitably surpass these thresholds and pose a systemic risk to the ecosystem.via TwitterIn the bull markets of past cycles, narratives of decentralization and censorship resistance take a back seat to the hottest trends in the moment.There’s no better time than a bear market to protect the foundational properties of the Ethereum network. Absent an active campaign to disrupt Lido’s dominance, it is likely the staking provider will continue to grow its market share.So, how can you get involved?Thankfully, crypto battles are waged at the margins and you don’t need to be a whale to participate in the decentralization of staked ETH.For starters, don't stake with Lido. Consider staking with Swell📝 and work to qualify for the SWELL airdrop later this year, spin up your own Rocket Pool📝 minipool with as little as 8 ETH to earn boosted yields by charging commissions on the Ether staked to your node, or deposit your Ether LSDs into unshETH to supercharge rewards with token incentives. For the technically sophisticated user, might we suggest running your own validator?No matter how you do it, moving your stake away from Lido will help in this battle against centralization, but the power of the purse alone won’t deter Lido from its path towards continued dominance; now is the time to take a page out of the activist playbook and get loud! 🗣️",https://www.bankless.com/sounding-the-lido-alarm,2023-06-12T00:00:00.000Z,https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/2023/06/NL_June_12_23-1-1.jpg,Jack Inabinet,Bankless,blog,Unknown Error,

Today, we dig into ten catalysts that BTC undoubtedly has going for it right now. - Bankless team Bankless Writer: William M. Peaster The recent resurgence in Bitcoin's popularity is a testament to its resilience and its potential to underpin new waves of blockchain experiments. But this doesn't mean you should dive in without understanding the current landscape! Here are 10 compelling catalysts that make buying BTC an interesting move right now. The first three catalysts are available for all to read, but you'll need to be a premium subscriber to access the full list. 🚀 1. For the culture 🤌 In early 2018, I remember selling all my BTC and doubling down on Ethereum because then it was already alarming how Bitcoin Maximalists were rising and getting increasingly toxic. Fast forward over five years to today and new innovations around Bitcoin have brought in creative and non-dogmatic crowds anew. At the helm of this cultural renaissance are veteran Bitcoiners like Nic Carter, Eric Wall, and Udi Wertheimer, who recently have done much to contest and take back the conversation from Bitcoin maxi pundits. In other words, Bitcoin is becoming fun again. So with maxis not totally dominating and new experiments abounding, the culture around Bitcoin is becoming one that more people no longer have to be embarrassed by, but can actually take pride in. The narrative has shifted from a single-minded focus on Bitcoin’s supremacy to more open-minded dialogue about Bitcoin’s potential in the broader cryptoeconomy, and that’s a catalyst for growth in more ways than one. See Bankless’ interview “Leaving the Bitcoin Religion with Nic Carter”","Dear Bankless Nation,Bitcoiners didn't wait too long after last week's SEC enforcement to signal that BTC's favorable regulatory positioning was a huge reason to be bullish.Today, we dig into ten catalysts that BTC undoubtedly has going for it right now.- Bankless team Bankless Writer: William M.

Growing demand for Bitcoin security 🔏More teams are starting to explore how they can “checkpoint” data onto Bitcoin from another blockchain so that blockchain can inherit Bitcoin’s considerable security guarantees. This checkpointing would be done via transactions to Bitcoin, so if adopted more widely this approach could help grow usage of Bitcoin over time. For example, the minds behind Babylon protocol are one such team that has developed a mechanism for checkpointing proof-of-stake (POS) blockchain data and beyond to Bitcoin. Set to go live on mainnet later in 2023, Babylon will initially specialize in enhancing the security of Cosmos zones.See our previous guide on How to Get Started on Cosmos3. Bitcoin coming to Cosmos 🌌Speaking of Cosmos, what if you could use your BTC directly in Cosmos projects, like trading on the popular decentralized exchange (DEX) appchain Osmosis?There are efforts to make this interchain utility possible, for example Nomic, which is building around the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) Protocol to create the Nomic Bitcoin Bridge. Currently active on testnet, the fully realized Nomic network will let users use nBTC (which represents BTC 1:1) in Cosmos-based apps. BTC becoming increasingly useful in places beyond Bitcoin is definitely a catalyst for growth going forward.4. Bitcoin rollups 🌀The future of the Ethereum scaling scene is rollups, and it’s increasingly looking like rollups will play a pivotal role in scaling Bitcoin over time, too.Someone who has done amazing research here is John Light, whose primer “Validity Rollups on Bitcoin” led to an outpouring of recent attention and efforts on Bitcoin L2s. In his research, Light noted Bitcoin and validity rollups, a.k.a. zk rollups, could conceivably complement each other as a “perfect match.” Bullish!Another team putting research into action in this arena is Rollkit, which rolled out its modular framework for launching rollups on Bitcoin in March 2023. Expect to see more Bitcoin rollups in the near future then. And just as L2s have been a catalyst for Ethereum and ETH, they’re now poised to be a catalyst for Bitcoin in kind in the years ahead.See our previous explainer What’s New with ZKs?5. The Ordinals NFT boom 💥Bitcoin is 2nd only to Ethereum in 30d NFT trading volume right nowBack in January, I first introduced Ordinals to Bankless readers, and since then the “Bitcoin NFTs” protocol has absolutely exploded in popularity.For a refresher, Ordinals is a system that converts individual satoshis, the smallest BTC denomination, into NFTs through an “inscriptions” process. It’s no gimmick, either. Ordinals inscriptions on Bitcoin are like “onchain minting” as we Ethereans would call it, albeit much more affordable than is generally possible on Ethereum. Accordingly, over the past six months a new NFT ecosystem has bloomed atop Bitcoin with incredible intensity and rapidity. As you can see in the image above, Ordinals have helped Bitcoin become the second-most popular blockchain for NFT trading behind only Ethereum at the moment.Source: TwitterWith the way things are going now, I don’t see this Ordinals craze slowing down any time soon. And as a person who was there for the 2017, 2020, and 2021 NFT surges on Ethereum, this 2022-2023 surge on Bitcoin is reminiscent. The ongoing culture bloom will be a huge catalyst for Bitcoin going forward.See our previous guide How to Mint a Bitcoin NFT6. Token experiments abounding ⚗️The arrival of Ordinals earlier this year set off an absolute flurry of additional tokenization experiments on Bitcoin. For example, this new thread series by Emblem Vault’s Jake Gallen (Part 1 + Part 2) detail over two dozen different proposals, standards, and experiments that have recently accelerated Bitcoin’s tokenization scene. Among the most popular of these new resources is the experimental BRC-20 standard, which in its own way tries to actualize a system akin to fungible ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum, though, again, BRC-20 is just one of many varied tokenization experiments right now. There’s SRC-20s, ORC-20s, BRC-721s, .sats, and on and on. The cambrian explosion of these sorts of experiments unfolding on Bitcoin is a very promising catalyst for the OG blockchain as we look ahead to the future.7. New Bitcoin DeFi possibilities 🪙The aforementioned boom in Bitcoin tokenization projects has led to an associated resurgence in Bitcoin DeFi efforts, a DeFi summer if you will. Some teams that are working in this category right now are Omnisats, a DeFi primitives metaprotocol built on Ordinals, and GoldStandard, another protocol team that’s devised the GRC-20 standard in an effort to build an overcollateralized $GOLD stablecoin on Bitcoin.Note that in general this new offshoot DeFi scene on Bitcoin is incredibly new and in many areas very primitive. Tread cautiously at first if you do decide to explore. But nevertheless, the continued rise of Bitcoin DeFi is a big catalyst indeed.8. Rare sats 💎The above “satributes,” a play on sat attributes, comes via ord.io, an Ordinals explorer and indexer. People will collect what they come to see as collectible, and the rich lore of Bitcoin combined with a newfound appreciation of individual satoshis thanks to the rise of Ordinals means more and more people are starting to see unique individual satoshis as collectibles. Some may find it silly, but it’s generally akin to the rise of “historic NFT” collectors on Ethereum. This growing collector base has contributed considerable activity to Ethereum, and sat collectors may do the same for Bitcoin over time. Bullish catalyst!9. Improved fee market conditions 💸The BTC supply is managed by a decreasing supply system, meaning the amount of new BTC created and able to be earned by miners is halved every four years, a.k.a. the “halving.” This process will continue until the full 21 million BTC supply is reached in 2140. But unless the price of BTC continues to rocket up over time, this continued drop in the block rewards may make it unprofitable for miners to secure Bitcoin long before 2140 ever rolls around. Indeed, in 2040 — 100 years before the final bitcoin is issued — the Bitcoin block reward will have dropped to 0.195 BTC per block. At that point, 20.99 million BTC, or more than 99.99% of the total supply, will have been mined. If the BTC price doesn’t compensate for this drop by itself, it will take transaction revenues — i.e. user activity — to keep Bitcoin profitable and secure. The good news for Bitcoin? Ordinals NFTs, tokenization efforts like BRC-20s, and the resurgence of Bitcoin DeFi have been quite profitable for miners lately. These are all newer indications that Bitcoin can potentially reach the teeming blockspace market it will need to over time. This is a fundamental improvement for BTC’s long-term outlook.10. April 2024 Bitcoin Halving 📈TV via TwitterNo “BTC catalysts” article can be complete without direct mention of the halving, which, as the chart above suggests, has always seemingly played out bullishly for the BTC price to date. Will the upcoming April 2024 halving play out similarly, and could it be the most impactful one on Bitcoin mining so far?We’ll have to see how things shake out from here, but there’s no question that there’s a ton of people in the cryptoeconomy who consider the halving very bullish and buy accordingly. As such, this is a catalyst that can’t be ignored!Action Steps:✅ Understand the big catalysts for Bitcoin right now!🦄 Catch up on everything you need to know about Uniswap V4📘 Read 8 Strategies to Balance Your Crypto Bets",https://www.bankless.com/10-bitcoin-buy-signals,2023-06-15T00:00:00.000Z,https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/2023/06/NL_June_15_23-2.jpg,William M.

Prometheum conspiracies take offSure, Crypto Twitter is no stranger to the occasional conspiracy theory, but there's something awfully fishy about the SEC's chosen posterboy for crypto compliance.Prometheum claims to be the first Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) member in the crypto space that has been registered by the SEC as a broker dealer. Prometheum is a digital asset exchange without any assets to trade as they only plan to support SEC-endorsed tokens. So, a crypto exchange without BTC or ETH... Hmm.The firm's co-CEO landed on people's radars this week when he testified in front of Congress and basically said that the crypto community was needlessly complaining and that the rules were clear, companies just didn't want to follow them. Gary himself praised Prometheum on CNBC last week, showcasing the firm as an example that the SEC isn't out to get crypto.So, what's happening here? It sure seems like the SEC is propping up a zombie exchange with absolutely no chance of success so that it can look like it's working with the industry... Check out Matt Walsh's Twitter thread below for more intel on the craziness.via Twitter4. 3AC-owned NFT sells for $6.2MThe NFT market may be in the doldrums, but investors are hoping that a high-dollar sale at Sotheby's could kickstart some excitement.

Another pro-crypto presidential candidateThe 2024 U.S. Presidential race is heating up, and while the Biden administration is getting more and more silent on crypto, a number of pro-crypto Republican candidates are entering the race.Miami Mayor Francis Suarez announced his candidacy this week. The Republican mayor has launched a number of initiatives over the years to turn Miami into America's crypto hub, working with venture firms and startups to set up offices in the city, while making a highly publicized push to receive his own salary in Bitcoin.Suarez and the rest of his Republican candidate counterparts face a steep challenge with Trump currently with a massive lead in early polling, though Trump's deepening legal troubles may provide a path for a current dark horse candidate.📺 Bankless Weekly Roll-UpOther news:Jack Dorsey's Block Bitcoin Wallet Opens BetaFrench Authorities Investigating Binance for ‘Aggravated Money Laundering’Mango Markets Exploiter behind alleged $116M theft will stand trial in DecemberBakkt delists Solana, Polygon and Cardano amid regulatory uncertaintyBinance, SEC say ‘progress has been made’ on deal to avoid asset freezeAbra Cease-and-Desist Reveals Ties to Binance and Prime Trust",https://www.bankless.com/blackrock-bets-on-bitcoin-2,2023-06-17T00:00:00.000Z,https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-17-at-10.05.04-AM.png,Lucas Matney,Bankless,blog,Unknown Error,

Polygon (MATIC)Token Type: Layer 2
Fully-Diluted Valuation: $6.9BWhy Polygon Will Make It:Polygon is an Etheruem scaling solutions that’s making moves during this bear market.Polygon launched their zkEVM in March 2023, and just announced their plans to convert their Polygon Proof-of-Stake (PoS) chain into a zkEVM Validium. A validium is a Layer 2 scaling solution which posts data off-chain rather than on-chain, making the tradeoff of having lesser security guarantees in exchange for greater scalability.The Polygon PoS chain currently has $981.3M in TVL, fifth among all Layer 1 and Layer 2 networks. The zkEVM Validium will still utilize the MATIC token as a means of decentralizing its sequencer set.Although fears surrounding MATIC’s status as a security may present a headwind, Polygon’s focus on the zkEVM, as well as the launch of the zkEVM Validium, should help the network grow and remain competitive with other L2s like Arbitrum, Optimism, Starknet, and zkSync while still driving value back to the token.3. Solana (SOL)Token Type: Layer 1
Fully-Diluted Valuation: $9.4BWhy Solana Will Make It: 
The Solana ecosystem is continuing to recover following a tumultuous 2022 that saw the price of SOL fall a whopping 94%.Moving forward, the L1 should benefit from increased scalability from the launch of the currently in-development Firedancer client, which could enable the network to process more than 1 million transactions per second (TPS). Solana’s NFT ecosystem also remains robust, generating the third highest NFT trading volumes over the past month behind Bitcoin and Ethereum.Although regulatory concerns linger following the SEC lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase which allege that SOL is a security, Solana’s positive momentum and infrastructure innovation should help it overcome this challenge and the remaining fallout of the FTX and Alameda Research collapse.4. Lido (LDO)Token Type: Liquid Staking
Fully-Diluted Valuation: $1.9BWhy Lido Will Make It: Lido has established itself as Ethereum’s largest staking entity. The liquid staking derivative (LSD) issuer is a behemoth, with a 31.3% share of all staking deposits, more than 2x its closest competitor, Coinbase.Lido should continue to benefit from the immense network effects of stETH, as its liquidity, integrations across DeFi, and strong security track record should help the protocol continue to attract deposits and maintain its leadership position in the staking landscape.Although there has been a push at the Ethereum social layer to diversify stake away from Lido, the above factors should help the protocol remain a core beneficiary of the continued increase in the ETH stake rate following the Shapella upgrade in April 2023.5. Rocket Pool (RPL)Token Type: Liquid Staking
Fully-Diluted Valuation: $788.5MWhy Rocket Pool Will Make It: Rocket Pool is another one of Ethereum’s largest liquid staking protocols, with a 3.2% share of all ETH staking deposits. The protocol has managed to attract stakers and validators alike in part due to its emphasis on decentralization via its ability to permisionlessly onboard node operators to the network.Like Lido, Rocket Pool should reap the benefits of its strengthening network effects, the protocol has grown 19% since the Shapella upgrade. This should drive value back to the RPL token, which validators need to buy and bond as slashing insurance in order to validate for the network.Although LSD competition is heating up with projects like Frax, Swell, StakeWise Ether.fi, Diva, and others all competing for market-share, Rocket Pool should continue on its growth trajectory over the coming months.6. GMX (GMX)Token Type: DeFi - Perpetuals DEX
Fully-Diluted Valuation: $732.5MWhy GMX Will Make It: GMX is one of DeFi’s largest decentralized perpetuals exchanges, having facilitated $8.2B in volumes and generated $42.8M in revenue over the past year. The protocol has emerged as the heart of Arbitrum DeFi, accounting for ~24% of the total DeFi TVL on the network.GMX should continue to grow over the coming months as a result of the launch of GMX V2, an upgrade to the DEX which will bring several new features to the protocol including the trading of more assets, new risk parameters, and increased order types.While it faces intense competition from other perps DEXs like dYdX, Kwenta, Gains Network, Pika Protocol and others, V2 should help GMX maintain its status as a market leader in the sector, as well as increase the yields that can be earned by GMX stakers, who take a 30% cut of all fees generated by the platform.7. Optimism (OP)Token Type: Layer 2
Fully-Diluted Valuation: $6.1BWhy Optimism Will Make It: Optimism has solidified its place as one of Ethereum’s leading L2s.Optimism Mainnet is currently the second largest L2 by TVL at $813.1M, good for the sixth highest total among all L1s and L2s. The OP Stack has also emerged as the leading solution for building custom rollups, with Coinbase, Binance, Ribbon, and others utilizing it to build Base, opBNB, and Aevo respectively. While competition among L2s is fierce, these wins should help the Optimism ecosystem continue to attract developers, users, and liquidity as it aims to execute on its vision of building the Superchain, a network of interoperable rollups connected by a shared sequencer. 8. Arbitrum (ARB)Token Type: Layer 2
Fully-Diluted Valuation: $11.4BWhy Arbitrum Will Make It: Arbitrum is another of Ethereum’s leading L2s.The optimistic rollup is the largest L2 by TVL, and fourth largest among all networks, with more than $2.2B locked in its DeFi protocols. Arbitrum is also bringing several innovative infrastructure developments to the table in the form of Orbit, its framework for developing Layer 3s (L3s are L2s that settle to another L2) as well as Stylus, which developers use to build applications in common programming languages like Rust and C++ on Arbitrum.This robust DeFi ecosystem, as well as technologies like Orbit and Stylus, should help Arbitrum stave off competition from the likes of alt L1s and L2s while continuing to grow and attract new capital, users, and applications.9. Immutable X (IMX)(Editor's Note: Immutable is indeed a Bankless sponsor but its inclusion in this list is not tied to its sponsorship in any way and was made at the sole discretion of this piece's writer. Questions/concerns? My DMs are open!)Token Type: Gaming
Fully-Diluted Valuation: $1.4BWhy Immutable Will Make It:Immutable X is developing one of the leading Web3 gaming ecosystems.Immutable is planning a level-up to its infrastructure, as it will be launching a zkEVM built using Polygon’s tech stack that should improve the network's throughput. The Layer 2 is also host to numerous successful titles including mobile trading card game (TCG) Cross the Ages which has topped the App Store charts in multiple countries. Immutable is also home to God’s Unchained, another successful Web3 TCG that is planning a mobile launch later this year, as well as Illuvium, a highly anticipated auto-battler and creature collector RPG that is currently in private beta.While there are numerous Web3 gaming ecosystems aiming to attract gamers and game studios like Ronin, Gala and Treasure DAO – the success of the titles in this ecosystem, as well as the scalability upgrade upon the launch of its zkEVM, should help Immutable remain competitive with these other players (pun intended).10. Uniswap (UNI)Token Type: DeFi - Spot DEX
Fully-Diluted Valuation: $4.8BWhy Uniswap Will Make It:Uniswap is DeFi’s largest decentralized exchange, having facilitated $429.6B in trading volumes over the past year while currently holding a 54.4% share of all DEX volumes.Uniswap has maintained its lead in the DEX sector following the release of Uniswap V3 in May 2021, which significantly improved the protocol's capital efficiency by introducing concentrated liquidity, or the ability to provision liquidity across a specific price range.Uniswap seems poised to retain and perhaps grow this position with the launch of Uniswap V4, the recently announced next version of the protocol. V4 brings both improvements in gas efficiency as well as greater functionality to Uniswap through Hooks. Hooks are executable code that enable customizations of liquidity pools to include features like dynamic fees, limit orders, TWAP orders, and more.Although V4 will not launch for several months, this newest iteration of DEX should help Uniswap maintain its leadership status.Action steps🪙 Check out other tokens we're bullish on in the Token Hub👁️ Read 10 Bitcoin Buy Signals",https://www.bankless.com/10-altcoins-that-will-survive-the-bear,2023-06-22T00:00:00.000Z,https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/2023/06/bearbankless-2.png,Ben Giove,Bankless,blog,Unknown Error,

Zuzalians together… for two whole months. Much more happened than just nerds talking about esoteric technologies! Beyond the “daytime classes” around frontier tech, Zuzalians were given the opportunity to build a lifestyle from scratch. Zuzalu was a blank-slate for everyone who attended – it was up to each individual Zuzalian to determined what they wanted to make of it.

The ‘Zu-Pass’ was the passport for Zuzalians, using zk-cryptography to keep Zuzalians private while enabling a community conversation space for the state and trajectory of the Zuzalu community.","Dear Bankless Nation,Earlier this year, our very own David Hoffman descended on Montenegro for two months to join a community dedicated to speed running the most exciting conversations in frontier technologies. Today, we dig into what Zuzalu was, why Vitalik was there and what you can learn from all of the podcast interviews Bankless conducted onsite!- Bankless teamHave you heard of Zuzalu? If you were watching the Bankless podcast on YouTube, you may have noticed that I was away from home… for two whole months! From March to May, I was in a small village in Montenegro. On the podcast, I briefly alluded to attending my first ever Ethereum hardfork event for Shapella, meeting a bunch of AI people, and going on a lot of regular morning cold plunges, but I never fully elaborated on what I was doing for these two months.What was going on? What was the purpose? What was achieved? Vitalik Buterin from Ethereum, Emad Mostaque from Stable Diffusion, and Grimes from… Grimes… all walk onto a stage… No, this isn’t the setup for a punchline… this was Zuzalu! Have you heard of Zuzalu?Zuzalu was a two-month long informal university for frontier technologies – all combined with an experiment in temporary community. Each week, various tech industry leaders curated workshops on topics related to emerging fields poised to shake up the platforms that our society operates on. via ZuzaluBefore I tell you about my version of Zuzalu and what it meant, I’ll toss out some recent headlines on Zuzalu for you to digest:“I Spent a Month Inside Vitalik Buterin’s Social Experiment—Here’s What It Was Really Like”“Meet the Crypto Rich Who Want to Live Forever: Inside Vitalik's Zuzalu”“Zuzalu Is 2 Months in Montenegro With Crypto Elites, Cold Plunges, Vitalik Selfies” Zuzalu is tough to pigeonhole. While Zuzalu may have been Vitalik’s brainchild, it was by no means led by him. You can see more on his initial vision in our interview further down. 👀Much like Etheruem, Zuzalu had a set of ‘core devs’ or the ‘Zuzalu core team’ that did the coordination, agenda setting and community management. Defining who was ‘in’ or ‘out’ of the core team was left to rough consensus. All ideas were valid and accepted, but in order to actually steer the Zuzalu ship, individuals had to commit to their ideas and execute them via their own leadership.What exactly Zuzalu was is up for interpretation. Zuzalu was a choose-your-own adventure of frontier technologies including:🦾 Artificial Intelligence🌳 Longevity🌆 Network-States, New Cities, and ‘Coordi-Nations’🧮 Zero-Knowledge Cryptography🧫 Synthetic biology♻️ Public goodsand of course, underpinning it all… EthereumMy Version of ZuzaluWant to really learn what Zuzalu was all about? The people, the knowledge shared, the big takeaways, et cetera?If you ask the 200 residents of Zuzalu what Zuzalu was, you’ll certainly get 200 different answers. But, Bankless Nation, what if I just showed you Zuzalu? And what if I had, say, recorded 18 podcast interviews with the entire spectrum of industry leaders there just for you all? Zuzalu was a polymath’s dream – endlessly fascinating paradigm shifting technology rabbit holes, and a new topic each week! Towards the bottom of this article, you’ll find 8 episodes containing the 18 interviews I recorded at Zuzalu. Each episode is focused on a different emerging technology that was the topic of a week. Do I want you to listen to every single one? Well… kinda. Do I expect you to? Absolutely not. Please, feel free to eject from rabbit holes that do not suit you in favor of the ones that do. The content here is meant to help you front-run the opportunity. The future is going to be weird, and it’s going to be heavily framed by the frontier technologies presented here in these eight episodes. If you listen to all of them, you will be far more prepared for the next phases of technological advancement in society.Frontier TechnologiesEvery week, a different industry was steering the Zuzalu ship. At a cursory glance, all of these technologies are very different from each other — what does synthetic biology have to do with network states or cryptography? But, beneath the surface are a collection of shared values, common visions, and similar problems (incumbents and nation-states – GAH!)Shout out to Woodstock-Rocker Phil Daian for the surreal picture opportunityThe cultural alignment between each industry was strong. Each is poised to bring drastic improvements to the human condition… if only we can solve some seemingly insurmountable problems. The AI people see a world of perfect coordination… if only we can figure out how to avoid the traps of dystopia along the way.The synthetic biology people see a world of perfect abundance and resource management in harmony with nature… if only we can figure out how to scale its generalizability. The longevity people are trying to cure death, the final frontier of health… if only we could be given the freedom to experiment and innovate. The network state people are trying to make governance competitive again… if only we could figure out how to establish jurisdictional independence and build new cities and countries from scratch.  The zero-knowledge cryptography people are trying to figure out how to provide privacy-as-a-service to help each of these above industries… but first we need to figure out how to make zk cryptography 100x more manageable. And lastly, there were the Ethereum people, who… actually I’ll save this for the end 😉Life at ZuzaluZuzalu wasn’t just about cross-pollinating industries - Zuzalu itself was an experiment in what future “intentional communities” could look like.

The 600,000-person country is potentially at the forefront of becoming one of the most tech-forward countries on earth. I had the opportunity to give an Intro to Crypto talk to a number of Montenegrins, the majority of which said they had never learned anything about crypto before, ever. The excitement and enthusiasm with which they received the talk left me glowing with optimism on the prospect of Montenegrin culture accepting Web3 values into the fold.Yet, the most exciting thing about Montenegro might be how open and willing Montenegrin government officials seem to be towards crypto. They appear ready to take the guidance of the crypto community and learn how to not only adopt crypto protocols, but also pioneer them within Montenegro’s own central bank and monetary programs.

A Note on Ethereum at Zuzalu I had one major takeaway from Zuzalu – one that’s defined my outlook for what this industry has in store for it. Of all the frontier technologies that had presence at Zuzalu, Ethereum (crypto) was the most developed. It seems to me that Ethereum is the eldest sibling of a bunch of frontier technologies, but it's waiting for its kin to come of-age. AI is in that moment, but it still has a lot of growing up to do. Meanwhile, Synthetic Biology, Longevity, Network States, DeSci… People have been working on these technologies for decades, but none have had their breakout moment in mainstream society. Yet, all of these technologies will ultimately need Ethereum’s support when they come of age. One of the central themes of Zuzalu was each industry attempting to lean on others to solve collective problems. Longevity people need Network States to further accelerate longevity research. Network States need Ethereum for governance and financial systems. DeSci needs Ethereum for capital coordination and resource allocation. Longevity and DeSci are both producing new forms of research together. While there are many problems with today's money, it will take time for Ethereum to be accepted and legitimized into the ‘old world’. The banks will fight it, the regulators will ban it, and Congress will continue to move at a snail's pace. Meanwhile, Ethereum sits on its hands waiting, while other frontier technologies learn how to stand up. Ethereum is in a weird spot – the old world is learning how to accept it, and much of the new world is still too new to use it. Eventually, time will solve both problems and we'll welcome a new future.The Zuzalu PodcastsHere you will find the collection of podcasts that I recorded at Zuzalu. 🟩 Zuzalu Preview and Interview with Vitalik🤲 Coordinations and Network States🧪 Synthetic Biology👴 Longevity🔬 Decentralized Science🦾 AI alignment🧮 New Frontiers of Cryptography🌍 Crypto in Africa These interviews range from as short as 20 minutes, to well over an hour.

Unfortunately, today’s summary judgment has left the crypto industry with a question mark hovering over the legality of this segment of liquid crypto markets.Source: US District Court, Southern District of New York🏆 The WinnersUnsurprisingly, the crypto assets pumping the most today are the ones that have been directly targeted by the SEC.XRP has absolutely ripped and the blue chip crypto assets targeted by the SEC’s previous enforcement actions have pumped harder than most on the news, with SOL and MATIC achieving double digit gains.Source: TradingViewIn one fell swoop, the FUD peddled by the SEC over select tokens' regulatory status over the past few months vanished. Coinbase, itself the target of an ongoing SEC investigation, has been one of today’s biggest beneficiaries (other than XRP) and is up nearly 25% on the day!While today’s summary judgment is not as broad as many in the crypto community might have wished, with concerns still remaining around the legality of secondary market sales, Judge Torres’s decision does help the crypto industry by establishing a crucial precedent that can be used by exchanges, like Coinbase, in their fight against the SEC.The ruling that XRP is not itself an investment contract is a significant blow to the SEC's case against @Coinbase and the other crypto exchanges.

While Judge Torres' decision is not ""binding precedent"" it is extremely well reasoned and will be cited in all motions to dismiss. https://t.co/FWSYgO8x3q— MetaLawMan (@MetaLawMan) July 13, 2023

😭 The LosersDespite being a “win” for the crypto industry, the same cannot be said for either of the parties involved in this case…For the SEC, today’s summary judgment is a resounding defeat!While the agency can continue to prosecute Ripple for unregistered institutional sales, many of Ripple's token distribution mechanisms were found to be completely legal and the path to legalizing secondary market token sales may have been opened with today’s verdict. The SEC will likely appeal Judge Torres’s ruling to prevent it from being used as the basis for future legal arguments.For Ripple Labs and the key personnel who facilitated the sale of XRP tokens directly to investors, this case is just getting started!Ripple Labs and the named co-defendants inevitably need to face the SEC in court, unless they manage to successfully appeal the decision that their institutional sales qualified as an unregistered securities offering.No, the most important part of the ruling is the Court found that your company broke the law and made illegal institutional sales. 

Your company made $700 million in unlawful profit. Good luck at trial claiming ignorance of Howey https://t.co/qSWEt34yFD— Joe Carlasare (@JoeCarlasare) July 13, 2023

Consequences are severe for failing to defend against the allegations, as the SEC is seeking the disgorgement of illegally raised funds (Ripple raised $729M through institutional sales) and want to prohibit the defendants from offering or selling XRP to any entity or person.Only time will tell how the SEC v. Ripple case plays out, but despite both parties in today’s decision being left at least partially dissatisfied, it's clear that investors see today's summary judgment as bullish for the crypto industry entities also facing SEC attention.Action steps📺 Watch Congressman Emmer Tackles the War on Crypto🚨 Read The SEC Endgame",https://www.bankless.com/winners-losers-xrp-ripple-judgment,2023-07-13T00:00:00.000Z,https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/2023/07/xrp_2-2.jpg,Jack Inabinet,Bankless,blog,Unknown Error,

Today, we unpack how you can get started playing around with some decentralized apps built on the LayerZero protocol. - Bankless team LayerZero is an omnichain interoperability protocol that supports cross-chain apps. It enables use cases like trading out of a token on one chain and into a new token on a different chain, all in a single transaction . That said, there’s no singular LayerZero app that you go to use. Rather, you can try the apps that are built on top of, or that have integrated with, the cross-chain protocol. And it turns out there are already many such apps, as you can see below! via LayerZero Corner So if you’re a newcomer to LayerZero tech, where to start? I’ve been thinking on that question, so I’ve curated a list of 4 basic activities you can try today to up your experience around this new omnichain frontier. Let’s start with the first app built on LayerZero, Stargate… 1. Bridge funds across chains using Stargate Overview Stargate is a bridging protocol that makes it easy to move funds from one chain to another. It attempts to tackle the “bridging trilemma” by guaranteeing immediate cross-chain transaction finality, supporting native assets (instead of wrapped ones), and facilitating liquidity with a unified liquidity pool system. How to use Go to stargate.finance/transfer Connect your wallet Input the network you want to transfer from (e.g. Ethereum), the asset you want to transfer (e.g. USDC), and the network you want to transfer to (e.g. Polygon Press “Transfer” and start the transaction with your wallet It will typically take a few minutes for your transaction to complete, so feel free to use layerzeroscan.com to track your transaction’s status while you wait! 2. Make a cross chain trade on Sushi Overview Sushi is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that’s always taken a “wide” approach to its deployments, as the protocol has now launched on no less than 26 different chains. To shorten the distance between these chains, so to speak, last summer Sushi launched SushiXSwap, the first cross-chain DEX built atop Stargate.","Dear Bankless Nation,Earlier this month, we dug into the LayerZero opportunity – highlighting what the protocol enables and what makes it important and relevant to crypto right now.Today, we unpack how you can get started playing around with some decentralized apps built on the LayerZero protocol.- Bankless teamLayerZero is an omnichain interoperability protocol that supports cross-chain apps.

Migrate a username from zkSync to PolygonOverviewThe zkSync Name Service is a fork of the ENS domain system on the zkSync Era layer-two (L2) scaling solution. It’s also integrated with LayerZero, meaning right now you’re able to migrate any registered names from zkSync to Polygon if you so choose. At the moment I’m not sure what the utility of this sort of migration is, but hey, it’s straightforward and easy to test out!How to useGo to app.zkns.domainsConnect your walletSearch for and register your name of choice, this should cost ~0.003 ETH after gas for most names right nowGo to the Account Manager page of the ZkNS app and select your domainToggle the “Crosschain” button, select Polygon as your destination network, and complete the send with your wallet4. Mint an omnichain NFT on HolographOverviewHolograph is an omnichain NFT protocol built on LayerZero tech that allows users to mint or bridge NFTs across a range of different chains, namely Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, BNB Chain, and Avalanche right now. Follow the project’s Twitter to see when new featured open edition (OE) drops are announced!How to useWhen a drop is live, go to app.holograph.xyzConnect your walletSelect the network you want to mint on + the number of pieces to mintPress “Mint” and complete the transaction with your walletThat’s it!

The energy is intense! There are so many launches and debuts to keep track of, but today, we're digging into the 8 announcements from EthCC 2023 that we're most intrigued by. - Bankless team Bonjour les amis! C’est vrai, Paris was just abuzz with the energy of the Ethereum community as EthCC 2023 unfolded in style. The event, known for its deep dives into the technical aspects of Ethereum and its ecosystem, has become a popular platform for major announcements, and this year proved no exception. For today’s post, let’s get you caught up on the biggest developments ( in no particular order ) to come out of EthCC 2023! 👇 1. Lens V2 🌱 At EthCC, Lens Protocol also just introduced the details of their V2 upgrade, which looks like it’ll be a big step towards realizing the Lens vision of an open and decentralized social layer for the web thanks to a host of new features. Zooming in, at the heart of Lens V2 is the concept of Open Actions, which allow users and developers to “bring their own smart contracts” to enable any external smart contract actions on any Lens publication, even cross-chain activities. Among other things, Lens V2 also introduces a new Profile Manager system that supports the ERC-6551 token standard, i.e. “token bound accounts” that lets users store NFTs inside of other NFTs. Accordingly, you’ll now be able to store all the content you collect on Lens directly within your Lens profile.

UniswapX 🦄Uniswap kicked things off with a bang at EthCC in unveiling its new UniswapX system, an open-source protocol designed to take crypto trading into next-gen territory. In short, UniswapX relies on a new Dutch auction-based mechanism known as Dutch orders, where a trade order’s price starts higher than the current market price and gradually decreases over time, incentivizing “fillers” to execute the order as soon as it becomes profitable. That said, the UniswapX system outsources its complex onchain and offchain routing needs through these third-party fillers, i.e. market makers, a dynamic designed to help traders find the best prices possible. Additionally, UniswapX aims to improve the trading experience in other important ways like via gas-free transactions, no-cost failed transactions, and protection against Maximal Extractable Value (MEV).Learn more: Read the new UniswapX whitepaperEditor's Note:Uniswap is indeed a Bankless sponsor but its inclusion in this list is not tied to its sponsorship in any way and was made at the sole discretion of this piece's writers.3. Chainlink CCIP ⛓Another big highlight at EthCC this week was Chainlink, the cryptoeconomy’s leading data oracle network, which announced the launch of its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) on mainnet.The protocol, designed to facilitate seamless communication between different blockchain networks, initially supports Ethereum, Optimism, Polygon, and Avalanche out of the gate, and it’s already being adopted by other DeFi giants like Aave and Synthetix. Likened to the ""TCP/IP of finance"" by Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov and the rest of the Chainlink team, the CCIP is aimed at creating a more capable and flexible DeFi ecosystem. An example of the system in action comes via the new Synthetix Teleporter system, which uses the protocol to burn and mint sUSD across both the Ethereum and Optimism networks. Learn more: Cross-chain by Chainlink4. Starknet Appchains 🟠We’ve seen a flurry of L2 teams rushing to tap into the benefits of enabling permissionless development on their rollup stacks. Optimism has the Superchain, Arbitrum has Orbit, and zkSync has Hyperchains. While individual strategies may open-source code to different degrees or have different underlying architectures, they all embody similar principles. Despite the Starknet team typically opting to “show first, and tell later,” it has chosen to break from this ecosystem mantra to add Starknet’s name to this list. “Appchains” were just announced at EthCC and the first Starknet Appchain is set to reach mainnet soon.These application-specific blockchains will allow teams to create bespoke chains that retain benefits of the public Starknet, like its native account abstraction and extremely high TPS, while avoiding its congestion and being able to implement features not supported on the public chain, such as unique fee market logic.5. Gnosis Pay + Gnosis Card 💸Ready to spend some magic internet money like it's cold hard cash – but in bankless style? Toward that end, Gnosis just introduced Gnosis Pay and Gnosis Card at EthCC. The former is a decentralized payment network for connecting web3 to mainstream payment systems, while the latter is a Visa debit card linkable directly to onchain, self-custodial wallets. With the Gnosis Card specifically, the idea is to let users enjoy the best of both worlds: enjoy self-custody over your crypto at all times while still being able to easily spend from your holdings whenever you want (and all without first having to send funds to your CEX account, sell for USD, withdraw your funds to your bank, then transfer to your PayPal app, etc.). As for Gnosis Pay, the system will notably use a combo of Gnosis Chain as an L1 for “user savings accounts” and a new custom Polygon Supernet-based L2 for “user spending accounts.”Learn more: Sign up on gnosispay.com6. Mantle Mainnet Alpha 🟢This week, L2 project Mantle Network unveiled the launch of its mainnet alpha at EthCC. This early phase of the system is designed to provide developers with a platform to build and test their applications ahead of a full network launch at a later date. Whatever happens going forward, Mantle is an L2 to watch for now thanks to its modularity: it relies on its own transaction execution, the Ethereum L1 for settlement, and EigenLayer for maintaining data availability (DA). This modular approach is undoubtedly a taste of what is to come in the Ethereum scaling scene, and Mantle is breaking ground here.7. Linea Mainnet Alpha ✔️Speaking of L2 mainnet alphas, on July 18th at EthCC the ConsenSys team also officially threw its hat into the scaling ring with the opening of its Linea zkEVM alpha to the public. This “zkEVM” style is the next great frontier for the L2 ecosystem in the way that it combines zero-knowledge (zk) proofs with full Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) equivalence toward high accessibility and high scalability. Additionally, Linea has a major distribution edge thanks to now reigning as the enshrined L2 across popular ConsenSys projects like MetaMask, Infura, etc. So with it finally being showtime for this fledgling network, it will be super interesting to see what level of activity takes off.8. EVM Extends Reach 🔷Ethereum conferences aren’t just for the Ethereum community! Teams from ecosystems far and wide take the opportunity to showcase their developments, especially ones that are Ethereum-related.Tezos and Solana are both trying to make it easier for Ethereum developers to migrate to their chains and announced their improvements during EthCC week. Tezos introduced Etherlink at EthCC, an EVM-compatible solution that settles to the chain, meanwhile Solana announced Solang, a compiler enabling developers to write smart contracts on Solana in Solidity.  Solidity is the native language of Ethereum and both Tezos and Solana are taking steps to allow developers to write contracts in the language. These chains are intent on continuing to fight the battle for users against Ethereum! Acknowledging the moat created by the EVM and providing flexibility for devs to code in Solidity is a necessary step to attract smart contract deployments from Ethereum-native dApps.The Big PictureThe advancements announced at this year's EthCC conference are pushing the frontiers of the Ethereum ecosystem forward across the board. As we continue to track these developments and their impact on the broader crypto landscape, it’s becoming clearer than ever that the future of Ethereum is poised to be teeming in all directions, from DeFi to web3 social!Action stepsCompare this year to last year: Review highlights from EthCC 2022 🗼Catch up on this week’s tactic: Getting Started with LayerZero 🌐",https://www.bankless.com/ethcc-2023-announcements,,https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/2023/07/NL_0720_1-1-2.jpg,William M.

C’est vrai, Paris was just abuzz with the energy of the Ethereum community as EthCC 2023 unfolded in style. The event, known for its deep dives into the technical aspects of Ethereum and its ecosystem, has become a popular platform for major announcements, and this year proved no exception.For today’s post, let’s get you caught up on the biggest developments (in no particular order) to come out of EthCC 2023! 👇1. Lens V2 🌱At EthCC, Lens Protocol also just introduced the details of their V2 upgrade, which looks like it’ll be a big step towards realizing the Lens vision of an open and decentralized social layer for the web thanks to a host of new features.Zooming in, at the heart of Lens V2 is the concept of Open Actions, which allow users and developers to “bring their own smart contracts” to enable any external smart contract actions on any Lens publication, even cross-chain activities. Among other things, Lens V2 also introduces a new Profile Manager system that supports the ERC-6551 token standard, i.e. “token bound accounts” that lets users store NFTs inside of other NFTs. Accordingly, you’ll now be able to store all the content you collect on Lens directly within your Lens profile. Crypto social is growing up!2. UniswapX 🦄Uniswap kicked things off with a bang at EthCC in unveiling its new UniswapX system, an open-source protocol designed to take crypto trading into next-gen territory. In short, UniswapX relies on a new Dutch auction-based mechanism known as Dutch orders, where a trade order’s price starts higher than the current market price and gradually decreases over time, incentivizing “fillers” to execute the order as soon as it becomes profitable. That said, the UniswapX system outsources its complex onchain and offchain routing needs through these third-party fillers, i.e. market makers, a dynamic designed to help traders find the best prices possible. Additionally, UniswapX aims to improve the trading experience in other important ways like via gas-free transactions, no-cost failed transactions, and protection against Maximal Extractable Value (MEV).Learn more: Read the new UniswapX whitepaperEditor's Note:Uniswap is indeed a Bankless sponsor but its inclusion in this list is not tied to its sponsorship in any way and was made at the sole discretion of this piece's writers.3. Chainlink CCIP ⛓Another big highlight at EthCC this week was Chainlink, the cryptoeconomy’s leading data oracle network, which announced the launch of its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) on mainnet.The protocol, designed to facilitate seamless communication between different blockchain networks, initially supports Ethereum, Optimism, Polygon, and Avalanche out of the gate, and it’s already being adopted by other DeFi giants like Aave and Synthetix. Likened to the ""TCP/IP of finance"" by Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov and the rest of the Chainlink team, the CCIP is aimed at creating a more capable and flexible DeFi ecosystem. An example of the system in action comes via the new Synthetix Teleporter system, which uses the protocol to burn and mint sUSD across both the Ethereum and Optimism networks. Learn more: Cross-chain by Chainlink4. Starknet Appchains 🟠We’ve seen a flurry of L2 teams rushing to tap into the benefits of enabling permissionless development on their rollup stacks. Optimism has the Superchain, Arbitrum has Orbit, and zkSync has Hyperchains. While individual strategies may open-source code to different degrees or have different underlying architectures, they all embody similar principles. Despite the Starknet team typically opting to “show first, and tell later,” it has chosen to break from this ecosystem mantra to add Starknet’s name to this list. “Appchains” were just announced at EthCC and the first Starknet Appchain is set to reach mainnet soon.These application-specific blockchains will allow teams to create bespoke chains that retain benefits of the public Starknet, like its native account abstraction and extremely high TPS, while avoiding its congestion and being able to implement features not supported on the public chain, such as unique fee market logic.5. Gnosis Pay + Gnosis Card 💸Ready to spend some magic internet money like it's cold hard cash – but in bankless style? Toward that end, Gnosis just introduced Gnosis Pay and Gnosis Card at EthCC. The former is a decentralized payment network for connecting web3 to mainstream payment systems, while the latter is a Visa debit card linkable directly to onchain, self-custodial wallets. With the Gnosis Card specifically, the idea is to let users enjoy the best of both worlds: enjoy self-custody over your crypto at all times while still being able to easily spend from your holdings whenever you want (and all without first having to send funds to your CEX account, sell for USD, withdraw your funds to your bank, then transfer to your PayPal app, etc.). As for Gnosis Pay, the system will notably use a combo of Gnosis Chain as an L1 for “user savings accounts” and a new custom Polygon Supernet-based L2 for “user spending accounts.”Learn more: Sign up on gnosispay.com6. Mantle Mainnet Alpha 🟢This week, L2 project Mantle Network unveiled the launch of its mainnet alpha at EthCC. This early phase of the system is designed to provide developers with a platform to build and test their applications ahead of a full network launch at a later date. Whatever happens going forward, Mantle is an L2 to watch for now thanks to its modularity: it relies on its own transaction execution, the Ethereum L1 for settlement, and EigenLayer for maintaining data availability (DA). This modular approach is undoubtedly a taste of what is to come in the Ethereum scaling scene, and Mantle is breaking ground here.7. Linea Mainnet Alpha ✔️Speaking of L2 mainnet alphas, on July 18th at EthCC the ConsenSys team also officially threw its hat into the scaling ring with the opening of its Linea zkEVM alpha to the public. This “zkEVM” style is the next great frontier for the L2 ecosystem in the way that it combines zero-knowledge (zk) proofs with full Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) equivalence toward high accessibility and high scalability. Additionally, Linea has a major distribution edge thanks to now reigning as the enshrined L2 across popular ConsenSys projects like MetaMask, Infura, etc. So with it finally being showtime for this fledgling network, it will be super interesting to see what level of activity takes off.8. EVM Extends Reach 🔷Ethereum conferences aren’t just for the Ethereum community! Teams from ecosystems far and wide take the opportunity to showcase their developments, especially ones that are Ethereum-related.Tezos and Solana are both trying to make it easier for Ethereum developers to migrate to their chains and announced their improvements during EthCC week. Tezos introduced Etherlink at EthCC, an EVM-compatible solution that settles to the chain, meanwhile Solana announced Solang, a compiler enabling developers to write smart contracts on Solana in Solidity.  Solidity is the native language of Ethereum and both Tezos and Solana are taking steps to allow developers to write contracts in the language. These chains are intent on continuing to fight the battle for users against Ethereum! Acknowledging the moat created by the EVM and providing flexibility for devs to code in Solidity is a necessary step to attract smart contract deployments from Ethereum-native dApps.The Big PictureThe advancements announced at this year's EthCC conference are pushing the frontiers of the Ethereum ecosystem forward across the board.

Huge shoutout to all of the Bankless citizens that came to our meetup at EthCC! We sadly didn’t think to capture a photo of the entire squad (just the team photo below), but being at our own private venue (with plants!) where everyone was there under the same context was a welcome respite from the hectic conference energy. The next Bankless meetup at Permissionless is going to be our largest yet! Permissionless is the home of IRL Bankless, since it's the only conference that Ryan actually goes to and the spiritual anniversary of when we actually met for the first time. Next stop: Permissionless There are TWO (2) conferences left for me this year. Permissionless (September, Austin) and Devconnect (November, Istanbul). Permissionless is the ideal balance between a well-refined operational conference machine that has been Blockworks' flex since inception, mixed with the crypto-nativeness that both Bankless and Blockworks brings to the content tracks being hosted there. If there’s just one conference to go to every year, it’s Permissionless. It’s the perfect stepping stone into diving deeper into the world of in-person events – newcomer friendly, crypto-native, and a ton of fun. Devconnect is going to be buzzing too. Devconnect is the younger sibling to the well-established Devcon, the only two events organized by the Ethereum Foundation. This event is truly meant for the Ethereum researchers, protocol devs, and those working on the hardest of problems in this space. But naturally, that focus attracts many to come and nerd-out with the rest of Ethereum. Action steps 📕 Read 8 Big Launches from EthCC 2023","Dear Bankless Nation, Every single year, EthCC gets a bit bigger, a bit more organized, and way more productive. The signal from EthCC this year was particularly strong! EthCC is a unique conference. It’s one of the oldest and most well-run Ethereum conferences that we have. So here we are, post-EthCC 2023. The noise of the bull market is behind us. The tourists are gone and only the settlers remain. So… where are we now, halfway through 2023? With EthCC offering such a strong checkpoint in the arc of Ethereum and crypto broadly, I’ve taken a moment to take stock of my main reflections and takeaways from the endless supply of conversations at EthCC 2023. Let's take a look at a few of the biggest theses I'm tracking! 👇Protocols are turning into commoditiestl;dr By the time the next bull market rolls around, there will be no shortage of compute and cheap storage for Web3. We’ll be ready to host the world. With the Dencun upgrade just around the corner, the Ethereum community is gearing up for the hardfork that finally introduces a massive scalability upgrade in EIP4844 (aka protodanksharding) giving Ethereum rollups access to a new cheaper form of blockspace on the L1 called ‘blobspace'. This long-awaited upgrade allows these L2s to finally become the most scalable versions of themselves.This upgrade marks a moment in crypto's development where we are approaching theoretical minimums of crypto-economic resource costs. It's not just Ethereum either, many different protocols are all seemingly approaching final forms in which they’ve minimized the cost to access whichever resource they're optimizing for. “Data availability” is the leading category – the type of resources that EIP4844 and alternative data availability solutions address. For the first time, Ethereum’s blockspace is becoming cheap! But Ethereum isn’t the only protocol optimizing for cheap data availability. Celestia, Avail, and EigenDA are all data availability protocols exogenous to Ethereum, which are scaling blockchains to levels we never thought possible just a few years ago! It doesn’t stop at data availability. Espresso Systems had a glowing reception at the largest EthCC side-event, the Modular Summit. With their shared sequencer testnent and Eigenlayer partnership, Espresso isn’t waiting for L2s to each build their own shared-sequencer system, instead focusing on one thing and one thing only: optimizing shared sequencing. Over in the zkRollup world, the ‘prover’ is the critical component that enables end-users to verify the validity of the zk-proof that scales zk-rollups. zkSync released their ‘Boojum’ upgrade, which boasts proofs capable of running on mid-to-high-end gaming GPUs. The significance here is that provers are now capable of running on consumer hardware rather than highly specialized enterprise-grade machines, meaning zk-proofs can more meaningfully decentralize these networks.These were only a few of the announcements that came out of EthCC, so apologies to all the teams building things that deserved to be included here! The few I highlighted represent just how far we’ve come in lowering the resource requirements to host and maintain trustless compute networks. There’s plenty left to do on this front, but for the first time we are able to see a finish line, and many teams are racing there as quickly as possible. Protocol convergence and verticalizationtl;dr – DeFi apps are discovering that their logical conclusion is a vertically-integrated superapp through which they supply a suite of services. Some of these apps are beginning to look a lot like each other. L2s all have their SDKs for scaling out new chains – the last missing pieces are chainbuilders and blockspace consumers (aka, apps)Aave, the money-market, now has a decentralized stablecoin GHO.  MakerDAO, the decentralized stablecoin, now has a money-market “Spark”. Frax has already been developing their own stablecoin-money-market-LSD ecosystem vertical for over a year now. These three protocols are experiencing some strong convergent evolution towards the same basin of attraction, and are now all competing in the same areas: TVL, stablecoin supply, and – most importantly – fees. Just take a look at the launch of UniswapX, a free-market competition-based order fulfillment protocol to facilitate best-possible decentralized order execution, that can also act as a bridge-abstraction layer by allowing the free market to choose their own solution for how to fulfill cross-chain DEX swaps –  i.e. I have Token A on Chain 1 and want Token B on Chain 2, so who can give me the fastest, bestest rate? My interpretation? UniswapX is the yin to the Uniswap AMM’s yang. Uniswap's iterations each increased in complexity; with v4’s addition of hooks, there is increasingly no guarantee of Uniswap AMM pool homogeneity. With the number of chains hosting potential Uniswap deployments also expanding, the order-routing optimization problem is becoming too unwieldy to be corralled by a rigid on-chain smart contract system. UniswapX builds a new vertical that harnesses whatever complexity Uniswap V1-V4 can throw at it, by simply allowing order execution and fulfillment to be done off-chain, with the minimum-viable-proof being made to ensure correctness.Here’s a useful thread from Dan Robinson on the UniswapX design - or just wait for the podcast we’re recording soon!Even after all of that, the L2 ecosystem still takes the cake on rapid convergence of similar design patterns. We got the OP Stack from OptimismThen we got Orbit from ArbitrumzkSync released the ZK StackAnd finally, with Polygon 2.0, we now have SupernetsJust like the L2s themselves, they’re all a little different. They each have their own strategy. But they’re all effectively going after the same vision that eventually there will be as many chains spawned from Ethereum as webpages spawned from HTTPS. So, which standard is going to produce a Cambrian explosion of chains?Optimism is unequivocally in the lead here, with three large chains and a smattering of minor ones. Polygon has ImmutableX. Arbitrum has Nova (albeit, internally produced), and while the ZK-stack is still looking to land its first large-scale adopter, more than a few startups have reported their choice of the ZK Stack to build their custom ZK chain. This, along with the Base mainnet coming sometime early August, is setting up Ethereum for the L2 summer that we’ve been crossing our fingers for since 2021. Focusing on consumerstl;dr – Our protocols are maturing to the point of consumer readiness. At the same time, our regulatory battles are cleaning up the industry and paving the way for increased adoption of crypto rails at higher levels in commerce, business, and society. If you’ve read this far, you’ve hopefully gathered how far along our protocols and infrastructure are. I declare that the protocol and infra sides of crypto are… solved problems. There is surely plenty left to do here, but exploring and settling this frontier has turned into a science. The frontier of crypto protocol development, for the first time in crypto’s history, is at a level of maturity that allows us to see the endgame. So now, with all of those big hard problem behind us… won’t somebody PLEASE build some apps?L2s have supplied more blockspace than we’ve ever needed before!Data costs are approaching their minimums! Latency and responsiveness are better than ever! It’s time to build apps again! Who is going to consume all of the L2 blockspace? Now that we have an ample supply of cheap and secure blockspace, let's start doing something with it. But, let’s not stop at blockchain apps! Let's go even higher up the stack and start productizing these systems! Won’t someone think of the consumer?It’s time to go to market – as an industry. Let’s build consumer-facing apps. Let’s hire crazy talented UX/UI designers whose job it is to service those without private keys, or those who only have their funds on Coinbase or Kraken. Let’s build applications for users who have never touched a blockchain before. Our protocols are becoming sufficiently cheap that their use can become subsidized by user acquisition. With cheaper and cheaper blockspace, new revenue models can begin to subsidize user transactions on our increasingly cheap L2s. A small but growing number of people have identified this current meta that we are in, and I’m hoping this post can emphasize this for the rest that haven’t figured this out yet. We’re (basically) done. Our protocols are ready. Let’s start doing the hard stuff of user research, clever abstraction mechanisms, and consumer-ready applications. Looking for some examples of this energy emerging out of the ether? Check out Gnosis – they debuted Gnosis Pay and Gnosis Card at EthCC.via Gnosis In the Gnosis ecosystem, there is now:Gnosis Safe (your high-security crypto vault)Gnosis Chain (high-speed L2 zkEVM Polygon Supernet)Gnosis Pay (Payments-focused chain built on Gnosis Chain)Gnosis Card (Fintech payments on top of Gnosis Pay) With Gnosis, we now have a world of trad-payments in the front with crypto protocols in the back. It’s truly a “buy your coffee with crypto” backend that has been discussed since the inception of Bitcoin. It’s up to Gnosis to turn this into something uniquely competitive to traditional payments, but it's worth noting that our infrastructure is now capable of spanning the Web3/TradFi gaps. At the same time that Ethereum is entering its era of consumer-readiness, crypto is fighting some of our largest regulatory battles ever. I don’t see these things as coincidences – the universe has a funny way of timing things. Once we’re on the other side of all of these regulatory trials… once we’ve finally defeated Gary Gensler, reformed the SEC, won our right to fairly issue tokens, and gotten quality legislation approved through Congress, crypto will be in the most regulatory-friendly state that it’s ever been in. Right now, crypto is currently “doing the hard things” on the regulatory front. We’ll never be accepted by larger players until we’ve gone toe-to-toe with the regulators and legislators, and come out the other side with a stamp of approval. You can’t kill crypto, so going through this regulatory battle is bullish no matter what. We’re going to come out intact and approved. We’ll have won some critical court battles, scammers and fraudsters will have had their reckoning, the good guys will once again be in the driver's seat, and large external players will have the green light that it’s safe to play in Web3. Can we be bullish now? pic.twitter.com/7qiyfn84AT— Bankless (@BanklessHQ) July 24, 2023

Modular Summit vs EthCCtl;dr – The modular ecosystem is a coalition of many different teams and projects that make up the Web3 stack – and it’s found its groove solving hard problems faster than the multi-chain ecosystem can present them. The Modular Summit, hosted the Friday and Saturday after EthCC, was sufficiently large and intellectually rich enough for the descriptor of ‘EthCC side event’ to not do it justice. EthCC has always been a welcome home to the Cosmos ecosystem and the developer rigor that it has attracted. That same energy has morphed into the modular side of crypto, which Ethereum is both a part of, and distinct from. I call this corner of the crypto ecosystem the ‘begrudgingly Ethereum-aligned’ side of crypto, where the modular pieces of infrastructure naturally find useful homes in the Ethereum landscape, but so many of these platforms would have totally enjoyed sitting on the monetary throne if ETH hadn’t already completely filled that seat (Celestia, Cosmos 😏). But I’m letting my tribalism get the best of me here – after all, modularism > maximalism 😆It’s funny to see the different archtypes that find the modular community home and resonate with it more than the 100% purely Ethereum crowd. It’s also interesting to see these communities naturally come together, as the technology form factors pair so well. Ultimately, Ethereum will come to absorb all the useful modules that the modular community will produce – 'tis the nature of the system to aggregate all useful open-source code into one single superstructure. Without question, the modular ecosystem is blazing into new technological frontiers faster than any other space in crypto. This should make sense – modularity means focusing resources on one single problem, rather than spreading out and trying to tackle multiple frontiers at once. The intellectual rigor being expressed by this corner of crypto has attracted all of the brightest minds in the space. I think you can expect great things coming from this corner of the industry.The Bankless meetup!Huge shoutout to all of the Bankless citizens that came to our meetup at EthCC!We sadly didn’t think to capture a photo of the entire squad (just the team photo below), but being at our own private venue (with plants!) where everyone was there under the same context was a welcome respite from the hectic conference energy.The next Bankless meetup at Permissionless is going to be our largest yet! Permissionless is the home of IRL Bankless, since it's the only conference that Ryan actually goes to and the spiritual anniversary of when we actually met for the first time. Next stop: PermissionlessThere are TWO (2) conferences left for me this year. Permissionless (September, Austin) and Devconnect (November, Istanbul). Permissionless is the ideal balance between a well-refined operational conference machine that has been Blockworks' flex since inception, mixed with the crypto-nativeness that both Bankless and Blockworks brings to the content tracks being hosted there. If there’s just one conference to go to every year, it’s Permissionless. It’s the perfect stepping stone into diving deeper into the world of in-person events – newcomer friendly, crypto-native, and a ton of fun. Devconnect is going to be buzzing too. Devconnect is the younger sibling to the well-established Devcon, the only two events organized by the Ethereum Foundation. This event is truly meant for the Ethereum researchers, protocol devs, and those working on the hardest of problems in this space. But naturally, that focus attracts many to come and nerd-out with the rest of Ethereum.

Everyone.","Dear Bankless Nation,Is crypto entering its last market cycle before its mature era begins? 

For today's column, David Hoffman makes the case that crypto will always have a Wild West, yet there are signs all around us that the ecosystem is trending toward being more dependable and safer. In other words? Crypto's growing up!- Bankless teamIf you look closely, there a handful of signs pointing towards crypto entering its last market cycle, before finally exiting its developmental phase and entering into it’s long-term era of maturity, stability, and growth.“The next cycle is going to be the last one” is kind of a meme-statement in crypto-land. It’s been stated before, and I don’t intend to make a clear convicted prediction about this. I am simply connecting some dots across the crypto landscape that point towards a new phase of crypto after this bear market is concluded. Let’s dive in!On regulation and institutional approval Crypto is going through its largest regulatory battles ever. Indeed, this has always been inevitable. As an industry based around money and finance, we cannot just waltz into mainstream acceptance without going through the trails of regulatory acceptance. In order for the biggest players to be able to play in Web3, they need assurances that the Nation-State and its monopoly on violence actually allows them to do so. “Becoming mainstream” means that crypto makes it through these regulatory trials. Don’t be scared. Crypto wins no matter what. All we have to do is wait until the hazing is over. It can only last so long. Crypto is an unstoppable force, and the Nation-State is not an immovable object. Gary Gensler will tell us to come in and register. Elizabeth Warren will stamp her feet. The banks will try and choke us. And Ethereum will produce the next block. History is ultimately defined by the arc of technology. Every blow that the anti-crypto regulators and legislators throw at us will ultimately be walked back by the power of the free market.This current phase of crypto shouldn’t be considered as “the nation-state attack on crypto” but instead “the nation-state hazing of a disruptive technology”. Like every freshman in college or every pledge of a fraternity, we just have to make it to the other side. Ripple just told Gary Gensler to sit down. Blackrock, Fidelity, and all the other big TradFi players have just signaled to the powers-that-be to cool their jets. Major brands, largely unconcerned with financial regulations, continue to explore crypto avenues. Our court cases will be fought, bills will be drafted, voted on, rejected, and then voted on again. It will be frustrating and painful. But it will one day come to an end. The regulators will eventually sit down. All we have to do is wait. Time is on our side. Once the regulatory trials are behind us, the cautious curiosity of mainstream interest in crypto will switch to a zealous goldrush, as they release that there is fertile ground out there, and the path to accessing these new frontiers are sufficiently clear and that the risk is acceptable. Protocol maturityAt the same time that we can start to see the light of the regulatory tunnel, we can also see the endgame for many the protocols that this industry is built upon.Also a large focus in my takeaways from ETH CC piece, many of the protocols that Web3 needs are evolving into their final form.

The answer is everything. All of them. Everyone.The long arc of EthereumIn 2015, Ethereum laid out an ambitious roadmap for itself. As the years progressed, this roadmap would only increase in ambitiousness, much faster than it would increase in completeness. As it turns out, the aspirations that Ethereum had for itself were far more complex than originally thought. Some time around 2019, something flipped. A mountain of R&D and a handful of critical egineering breakthroughs turned a new page on Ethereum. “Ethereum 2.0” or “Serentity” (now all just called ""Ethereum"") had a clearly-defined roadmap where the only thing left was testing and writing code. From 2019 to 2023, code was written, and code was shipped. Ethereum went from a monolithic PoW chain, to a modular, expressive PoS chain with networks upon networks spawning from its base. Promises were made, and promises were kept. The most amazing thing about this arc of Ethereum is the commitment to the original vision that was set in 2015. While the implementation details changed, and the path itself was uncharted, the original destination for what Ethereum would ultimately become never wavered.Across its entire history, betting against Ethereum’s trajectory and Ethereum developers has never worked out. With EIP4844 shipping sometime late this year (probably, my estimation), Ethereum will have locked in a perfect track record of commitments. Keeping promises and sticking to a vision shows the outside world that the things being built are being built with conviction, intent, and purpose. We’re not crazies - we’ve been building towards the same vision for 8 years now. You just didn’t understand it until now. Before this point, it was possible for the outside world to look in at Ethereum and see a bunch of confused monkeys running around in chaos. But now, one would look back and see a beauty in the chaos, as Ethereum ultimately progressed into the thing that the world needed it to be – a decentralized internet compute layer for value. A network for networks.ETHAlongside the blossoming of Ethereum is the story-arc of ETH. Sufficiently a shitcoin in 2015, ETH the asset has made commensurate progress alongside the protocol it runs along. From the highly inflationary and arbitrary 5 ETH per block in 2015, ETH is now an natively yield bearing asset with algorithmic monetary policy. With real yield and no human intervention, it stands in sharp contrast to the monetary policy of the Dollar and the farce that is the Federal Reserve. Other than MEV burn, which further adds to the monetary strength of ETH, there are no further upgrades to ETH’s monetary policy. If there’s one thing that big money likes, it’s yield. And ETH’s yield stands head-and-shoulders above the rest. ETH stakers receive yield while ETH itself is simultaneously deflationary. Bond holders get positive nominal yields but negative real yields – ""real"" being the more important descriptor here! 😆 Compare that to the global understanding that the USD and US Treasuries must decline in value in real terms in order for the worlds financial system to hold itself together, and you have a story for ETH’s future that just writes itself. The evolution of ETH towards its throne of ultra sound money shows the outside world that there is something uniquely new here in the crypto industry. Through cryptography and networks, we can create financial assets with never-before-seen properties. No, the story arc of crypto assets with strong value propositions does not stop at Bitcoin… we are not settling for ""digital gold."" We’re carving new frontiers, and ETH the asset can neatly fit inside preexisting mental models for how assets are valued, while simultaneously being something completely different than all previous assets that have come before it. The summary of these two sections, Ethereum and ETH maturity, can be summarized by both growing lindy and the successful navigating of uncharted waters. When it comes time for societies attention to turn back towards crypto, they will see a protocol and its asset with a long track record of coherent and directional progress towards a vision that hasn’t wavered since its inception. The legitimacy that this earns the Ethereum ecosystem will propel it into a cryptoassets that is sufficiently ""safe"" for people to take career risk on, and start to recommend ""looking into it"" at high and higher levels. This starts ETFs, a ball that’s already been rolling.ETFs are hereThe race for the ETF has begun. Like I said in the above regulatory section… all we have to do is wait. The arc of history is defined by technology. Gary can only hold the door closed against crypto ETFs for so long - eventually the power of the free market will get its way. It appears that time is sooner rather than later. Once Bitcoin blasts open the doors of crypto-asset ETFs, it becomes harder to stop additional assets from finding their way into their own ETFs. Making some assumptions here, but we’ll get the BTC ETF and the ETH ETF won’t be far behind. If these things pair with the incoming bull market, the pipes of capital between crypto and the outside world will be the largest they’ve ever been. This will pair with the above regulatory conversation. By the end of this incoming cycle, the ticker symbols B-T-C- and E-T-H will be commonplace next to APPL and AMZN, for every major brokerage in the world.The cycles are diminishing anywaysBitcoin returns over the years have always been suppressed. If you were insane enough to buy bitcoin in 2010, congrats because the rise to the 2011 was the steeping, sharpest increase in gains that Bitcoin ever had. Every subsequent cycle has taken more time for lower returns. Obviously it works this way. One of societies biggest talking points are that crypto-assets are too volatile. Well, every cycle, crypto assets become the least volatile they’ve ever been, while simultaneously the traditional equities and bond markets are the most volatile they’ve been in over 3 decades. TradMarkets merely adopted the volatility. Cryptomarkets were born in it. Molded by it! And now, our markets are evolving into stability, while trad markets decay into volatility thanks to the hands-on nature of the Fed. With the easing of regulatory pressures, and the attraction of sustainable, non-speculative adoption of crypto networks due to the maturity of network infrastructure, a lot of the volatility of crypto can be damped simply due to adoption. The larger the boats get, the harder they become to rock. And, the conclusion of my above infrastructure sections is that our crypto boats are ready to scale to whatever size society needs them to be. The arks are ready… its time to board them!Crypto civilization growsCrypto will always have its Wild West. There’s no putting the genie back in the bottle – once you give society permissionless finance, then the west-facing frontier cannot be stopped. Thanks to the ERC20, anyone can mint a memecoin, but now thanks to the OP Stack, this next market cycle anyone will be able to mint a meme-chain. Hold on to your butts with that one. But now, with this cycle, we’re going to see the civilizations in the East establish. The safety and security of civilization. The East and West stand in opposition to each other. Those who seek freedom and adventure go west, in order to escape the tyranny and oppression of civilization. But some people want the safety and security of civilization! Mainstream adoption requires roads, plumbing, laws, and policemen. The margins of crypto will march west, but the body of crypto will evolve into a predictable, dependable, regulatory-approved environment where the less-adventurous feel safe exploring. Parts of crypto will start to be considered sufficiently safe and secure that Web2 normies will feel safe living here. Smart contract wallets with account recovery, highly battle-tested apps, high-trafficked L2s, Base… these things will become the civilization of crypto and will be a place where the less adventurous can still feel safe participating in crypto society. But for everyone reading this, being here will be a choice. We’ll know the secret paths to the more hidden corners of crypto… where tokens manifest and degens play. For better or for worse… we’ll always have the Wild West of crypto. -David",https://www.bankless.com/the-last-crypto-cycle,2023-08-07T00:00:00.000Z,https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/2023/08/NL_0807_1-2.jpg,David Hoffman,Bankless,blog,Unknown Error,

Let’s “dive” in 🏊‍♂️Upgrading ShipsAs our transactions pass through Ethereum’s liquidity, they disturb its waters. We imbalance the pools. We cause disturbances on the surface, where price is discovered, and where onchain monsters can track our movements. In the image above you’ll see two different kinds of boats, each representing a specific strategy for optimizing how you navigate Ethereum’s liquidity and swap tokens at the best possible rate. On the left, we have your typical onchain DEX trade. You input the token you want to sell, fill in the token to buy, set the amount, and specify the amount of slippage that you’ll receive. You input all of this, and your DEX front-end specifies a route for you to follow, codifying it into an immutable transaction. You need to adhere to this route strictly to protect yourself from MEV bots, and you’ll eat up plenty of gas as your ship intensely blasts through Ethereum’s pools of liquidity.But on the right, you have an ✨offchain signed order✨We’ll break down exactly what this means further down, but if the onchain DEX trade is a slow, heavy, wake-leaving, pool-disturbing tugboat, then an offchain order is a sleek, streamlined, stealth ship. It cuts through the water while leaving no wake. It can’t be tracked, and it’ll get you and your payload from point A to B without anyone knowing how you got there. If you want to avoid the monsters, don’t disturb the water… leave no wake!Image: PolestarIf you’ve ever read the oft-referenced essay “Ethereum is a Dark Forest” from the folks at Paradigm, you’ll know that Ethereum is not the safest place – thar’ be monsters! Attracted by the disturbances in liquidity pool balance, MEV monsters ascend, consuming the disorder that our transactions leave behind as they produce a rebalanced pool. These monsters crave balance. If the waters of Ethereum aren’t perfectly still, then there’s an arbitrage opportunity for some bot somewhere to satisfy. Bankless Nation, what if I told you there was a different way to cross Ethereum’s waters? What if, instead of bogging ourselves with heavy, slow machinery to protect ourselves, we chased a different strategy? Let me introduce you to the new meta of offchain signed orders.Offchain Signed Orders, aka “intents”Offchain signed orders employ a completely different strategy for navigating Ethereum. Offchain orders aren’t transactions - you don’t broadcast them to Ethereum. Instead, you simply note the asset you want and the chain you want it on, and broadcast that request to the offchain world, declaring “I want these things to happen, and I’ll auction off the right to be my service provider to the lowest bidder.” Upon hearing of said opportunity, a marketplace of vessels descend upon your position, inspect your proposal, and wait for the terms they’re interested in.UniswapX produces offchain signed orders with Dutch auctions embedded in them. So, say, you broadcast your intent to buy 1 ETH on Optimism, using 2,000 USDC… but you’ll start your offer at 2010 USDC and ratchet the order increments downwards to 2000 USDC. With this, a million ships appear to inspect your offer, all in a standoff with each other. The order begins at 2010 USDC… but that’s ludicrous! ETH isn’t worth a 10th of a penny more than 2003.75. Every single captain worth their salt knows that that is the current state of Ethereum’s liquidity pools. The ships wait, as the proposed price slowly falls over the moments… $2,009… $2,008… $2,007…. All of the bots wait for their moment to strike, to grab the payload, and to deliver it to the other side of Ethereum. $2,006… 2,005... and then, all of a sudden, pop! Out of the swarm, a single ship emerges, darts forward, grabs the payload, stuffs it inside of it, and zips off into the horizon to fulfill the job. The execution price? $2,004.31. All MEV bots update their price model for ETH: ETH is now $2,004.31.Meanwhile, our transaction is safely contained inside this random ship that just picked us up on the docks. There are a few things different about this ship than the ships we are used to. First, it doesn’t leave a wake. It’s not disturbing the surface of the water. The other MEV monsters can’t detect it. Second, we’re not even on Ethereum. Our ship isn’t onchain. It’s an offchain signed order, and being an offchain signed order fundamentally inverts the relationship between swapper and the MEV monsters. And that ship from earlier, the one that executed the order for an unexpectedly high price? That was an MEV bot. You used an offchain signed order to pay for a ride across Ethereum on top of an MEV sea monster. You turned a threat into a service provider. Instead of building our own ships to navigate Ethereum, we simply hire a ride from a pre-existing ship that has been shaped by the massive evolutionary forces that exist inside the MEV space. We use the free market to discover the best ship for the job, all inside of a single Ethereum block. By codifying our intent into an order (not a transaction), we created a protective shield around the body of our transaction, and said to the world of MEV bots: “you can do anything to me that you want… so long as you don’t penetrate this shield”. Then, using a dutch auction, we slowly contracted the diameter of the shields until the smallest margin of the transaction body was outside of the protective shield. Once enough margin is exposed, the most efficient and effective MEV monster snapped it up before any other MEV bot could get to it. Instead of fighting MEV bot monsters, we ride them!Image: leywad/deviantartThis is why offchain signed orders will likely become the new meta for swapping in Ethereum. Rather than working against MEV bots, we can instead work with them by operating inside the same plane of dimension in which they live. No longer will we have to build computationally heavy, encumbered transactions. We will now let the free market discover the right ship for the right job.Finishing Thoughts This ‘new meta’ for swapping on Ethereum opens up a bunch of new doors for opportunity. We are seeing the landscapes of onchain order routing, offchain MEV, bridges, and market makers all converge together into the same space. Competition will be fierce, and the winner will be the average joe swapper. The intent-based order meta also deals a significant blow to UX challenges that the multi-L2, multichain landscape bring. Ethereum made a compromise in its rollup-centric roadmap: achieve scale, preserve decentralization, but create asynchronous state across asynchronous chains. It’s fantastic for allowing 10,000 networks to bloom, but produces challenges when trying to abstract away these cross-chain-complexities to the end user. With intents, a lot of the complexities between crosschain liquidity, chain swapping, and bridge selection, are all choices that will be made by the technical backend service providers. All the users have to do is hop on the ship and enjoy the ride. The psychological burdens of the above choices go to the service providers who are scraping for pennies. Intents will ultimately become a large piece of the puzzle to solving Ethereum’s fractured state across asynchronous chains.  There’s also the conversation around transaction welfare. Intents are great for individuals, but they become even better when their benefits compound. In the most ineffective world, every swapper trading on the ETH USDC Uniswap pool would line up in serial order, and rebalance the pool according to their trade. User 1 would add 50 USDC and take away some ETH, User 2 would take away 2000 USDC and add some ETH, person 3 would make their swap etc. etc., and then everything would become bundled into a block and that block would be processed. At every instance of every trade, every swapper would pay gas for rebalancing the pool. With the intent meta, intents can be aggregated together, and the relevant AMM pool would only have to be rebalanced once, while many user trades can simply cancel each other out, without having to disturb the pool. This is the innovation behind CoW Swap, one of the original creators of this intent-based model. Once the entire meta around onchain DEXs moves to intents, the entire landscape of Ethereum swapping will be able to grow more efficient because trades will be able to be matched against each other before ever making it onchain.A special thanks to Hasu for help reviewing this piece.",https://www.bankless.com/a-hitchhikers-guide-to-riding-an-mev-bot,2023-08-14T00:00:00.000Z,https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/2023/08/NL_0814_1-3.jpg,David Hoffman,Bankless,blog,Unknown Error,

Meanwhile, Beeple, another crypto-native artist with a mainstream audience, dropped his daily 3D animation – this one featuring the crypto social platform of the moment.

3. Tech & Community ExperimentationA little building and a little drama emerged out of the crypto-native side of friend.tech this weekend. Foobar, a popular solidity developer, released a Friend Share tokenization wrapper, allowing people to fractionalize friend shares into ERC20 tokens – 1 share turning into 100 ERC20 tokens. But an unmentioned 5% royalty tax split between Foobar and the friend.tech account who uses it caused some drama. Other devs forked the code and removed the royalty fee, and now friend.tech users are going straight to the friend.tech contracts and fractionalizing their shares using these lines of code.🚨Introducing $LEVI, an ERC20 token that represents fractionalized shares of my @friendtech chat💎⚡️$LEVI represents 1% of an underlying share of me on @friendtech. You can buy $LEVI on @VelocimeterDEX for $16🔥

By holding 1 $LEVI token, you get access to my discord preview…— Levi (@0xCaptainLevi) August 20, 2023

The possibility of these fractionalization experiments have triggered some interesting questions. Is the real value of friend.tech in the underlying contracts? What if we just jettisoned the friend.tech front end and built our own, using the same contracts as a foundation?Hey friend tech wrapped shares ppl, @thepaulbalaji forked the code and removed the foobar fee.

Use this instead if you must.https://t.co/H6bds2jxXf— scoopy (@scupytrooples) August 20, 2023

4. Plenty of Untapped PotentialWith some venture money in hand, friend.tech's developer is staring down plenty of opportunities ahead of it.The big question left to be answered: when friend.tech adds more basic features to their app, will the demand for friend-shares increase? Right now, the only utility that friend.tech gives is the ability to talk to the accounts that you own shares of.The friendstech meta gonna vastly change once they add pictures— Sisyphus (@0xSisyphus) August 21, 2023

But what if the app enabled sharing media –  what new use cases might spring up? Are there other low hanging fruit feature updates for the platform to implement? How much innovation is there left to unlock here?pic.twitter.com/jPQ5XaBlDT— gaut (@0xgaut) August 20, 2023

Big Takeaway: Is SocialFi a thing now?Friend.tech has dominated the Web3 narrative for the last 10 days. Maybe it has another week left in it? Maybe more?Perhaps friend.tech is just the latest new Ponzi-game for the crypto-degens to play with. Maybe friend.tech isn’t it, but just a sign for things to come? Is SocialFi the hot new thing? Will social apps with crypto-native features be the bridge to the mainstream?Chris Burniske thinks so. He says it's a natural progression for the UX and UI designers to take over and polish the rough edges that the degens who aped in early have been ignoring.To pull us from the depths of last bear, DeFi games were built to get the apes aping. It follows that social games, like FT, are the catalyst for the apes this cycle. 

Apes always ape first — then, the rest of society comes later as follower apps clean up the experience.— Chris Burniske (@cburniske) August 21, 2023

One of my big takeaways from ETH CC is that our protocols are ready for prime-time. There are still improvements to be made in our base-layer protocols, but they’re mature enough to be able to enable most any app that can be imagined.Just a month after I voice that take, we get friend.tech.

Opportunity Type: Use the Protocol
Activity: Long or Short the FRIEND IndexWhat is it?
Aevo is a new decentralized derivatives exchange that specializes in options and perps trading. Built on its own bespoke optimistic-style Aevo Rollup and secured by Ethereum, the Aevo protocol represents the next wave of “appchain” DeFi apps. The exchange combines an offchain orderbook system with onchain settlements, allowing for the efficient matching of orders while ensuring that trades are executed and settled securely through smart contracts. The idea? Offer traders the best of both worlds: the speed and flexibility of offchain operations, coupled with the transparency and security of onchain execution.
Why it’s a degen play:
Aevo just listed FRIEND-PERP, which allows you to long or short FRIEND, an index that tracks the current market cap of social tokens on friend.tech. It remains to be seen whether friend.tech will continue to boom in popularity for the foreseeable future, or if it’s going to pan out as a fad, but it’s got huge attention right now and it could swing either way, so the surf’s certainly tradable here and perps offer a way to leverage up on the action in either direction. Derivatives and new L2s aren’t for the faint of heart though, so approach cautiously if you want to try this!🌊 HyperliquidWebsite | Twitter
Opportunity Type: Use the Protocol
Activity: Long or Short the FRIEND indexWhat is it?
Hyperliquid is an orderbook perpetual futures decentralized exchange that aims to bring some of the best features of centralized exchanges (CEXs) into the onchain world. Operating on the Hyperliquid L1, a purpose-built blockchain utilizing Tendermint for consensus, it's designed to handle all core exchange processes transparently onchain and support up to 20,000 orders per second thanks to its block latency efficiency. Why it’s a degen play:
Like the Aevo FRIEND-PERP play, Hyperliquid just launched its own FRIEND-USD perp that also allows traders to long or short a FRIEND index. This index contract tracks a formula instead of market cap, and the formula monitors the accounts of 20 top friend.tech users. Trading on Hyperliquid's FRIEND-USD is on low leverage (max 3x) and isolated margin only, reflecting the inherent risks. The platform itself has also warned of low liquidity, high volatility, and increased liquidation risk, so watch out if you jump in. 💱 Base VelocimeterWebsite | Twitter

A Velodrome fork, Velocimeter is a decentralized exchange that started out on the Canto network but has since expanded to a handful of other L1s and L2s, including most recently to Base where considerable activity has flowed to in recent weeks. Whether you want to swap tokens, provide liquidity, or receive pool vote bribes, Velocimeter is an early avenue to consider while the Base DeFi scene is just beginning to come into its own. Why it’s a degen play:
Is this just another Velodrome fork? Perhaps at first sight, yet it’s also the first DeFi project to implement foobar’s Wrapped Friends mechanism into its frontend. This system lets you easily mint your own ERC20s via the “factory” function of the friend.tech platform’s smart contract, and now it’s straightforward to try and trade these tokens on the Velocimeter. Currently the DEX is even offering token farming opportunities on some prominent people's key pools.🧌 Sproto GremlinsWebsite | Twitter

Despite your better judgments, are you intrigued by HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu? Perhaps you should also check out the token’s absurd NFT counterpart series, Sproto Gremlins, which are “3,333 unique manifestations of the $BITCOIN egregore.” If you’re wondering what egregore means because you’re not an esoteric wizard, it’s a “non-physical entity that arises from the collective thoughts of a distinct group of people.” So let me help you get this straight… Sprotos are digital manifestations of the nonphysical HarryPotterObama spirit entity that itself has been manifested by sh*tcoin traders. Just another day in crypto. Why it’s a degen play:
On the shoulders of the $BITCOIN surge, Sprotos have captured attention in recent months at a time when many NFT PFP projects have faded into the background. If the HarryPotterObama spirit gods continue to smile on us with more good tidings for $BITCOIN, these Gremlins have a chance to be the associated alpha play in the NFT ecosystem in kind for the duration of the bullishness. It does seem unlikely this collection will have staying power beyond this current absurdity meta, but on the flip side we should expect the unexpected these days in the cryptoeconomy. Keep an eye on the Sprotos accordingly. 🟣 Ajna FinanceWebsite | Twitter

The protocol enables the creation of permissionless lending markets for any ERC-20 (fungible tokens) and permissionless borrow markets for any ERC-20 and any ERC-721 (NFTs).Instead of relying on oracles, Ajna uses an internal order book that makes lenders set the value of their assets. Ajna can be accessed through third-party interfaces, like Summer.fi.Why it’s a degen play:

The exchange combines an offchain orderbook system with onchain settlements, allowing for the efficient matching of orders while ensuring that trades are executed and settled securely through smart contracts. The idea? Offer traders the best of both worlds: the speed and flexibility of offchain operations, coupled with the transparency and security of onchain execution.
Why it’s a degen play:
Aevo just listed FRIEND-PERP, which allows you to long or short FRIEND, an index that tracks the current market cap of social tokens on friend.tech. It remains to be seen whether friend.tech will continue to boom in popularity for the foreseeable future, or if it’s going to pan out as a fad, but it’s got huge attention right now and it could swing either way, so the surf’s certainly tradable here and perps offer a way to leverage up on the action in either direction. Derivatives and new L2s aren’t for the faint of heart though, so approach cautiously if you want to try this!🌊 HyperliquidWebsite | Twitter

Hyperliquid is an orderbook perpetual futures decentralized exchange that aims to bring some of the best features of centralized exchanges (CEXs) into the onchain world. Operating on the Hyperliquid L1, a purpose-built blockchain utilizing Tendermint for consensus, it's designed to handle all core exchange processes transparently onchain and support up to 20,000 orders per second thanks to its block latency efficiency. Why it’s a degen play:
Like the Aevo FRIEND-PERP play, Hyperliquid just launched its own FRIEND-USD perp that also allows traders to long or short a FRIEND index. This index contract tracks a formula instead of market cap, and the formula monitors the accounts of 20 top friend.tech users. Trading on Hyperliquid's FRIEND-USD is on low leverage (max 3x) and isolated margin only, reflecting the inherent risks. The platform itself has also warned of low liquidity, high volatility, and increased liquidation risk, so watch out if you jump in. 💱 Base VelocimeterWebsite | Twitter

Unlike the Bitcoin that BlackRock is excited about, Ethereum’s homegrown $BITCOIN is strictly powered by memes; a quick glance at the memecoin’s webpage will inundate you with all kinds of dank memery.The token’s success has managed to kick off a wave of obnoxiously named copycat tokens, like HarryPotterObamaPacMan8Inu ($XRP) – a sh*tcoin that managed to briefly achieve a market capitalization as high as $95M. Why it’s a degen play:
While it is unclear how much further $BITCOIN has to run, this ticker has emerged as the market leader among a sea of derivative projects. It is possible that this coin will receive the strongest inflows of any in the memecoin sector, given its relative establishment.Catching a ride on a memecoin rocketship has previously offered some a path towards profit, but it is vital to remember that you are always someone else’s exit liquidity when trading sh*tcoins!

Opportunity Type: Ape the Token
Ticker: RDO
Market Cap: $4.5MWhat is it?Rodeo Finance is a yield protocol on Arbitrum that makes use of undercollateralized leverage, which lets users amplify their positions in various DeFi strategies. At its heart, Rodeo Finance revolves around two main stakeholders: liquidity providers, who serve as passive lenders and earn yield by providing single-sided deposits, and yield farmers, who can borrow using up to 10x leverage for farming opportunities. Why it’s a degen play:
After suffering an exploit in July 2023, the Rodeo Finance team is on the rebound and just relaunched its yield farms. As part of the relaunch, the project also just unveiled new vault products and evolved RDO tokenomics. RDO is very small right now, but if Rodeo can continue to bounce back with this second wind and become a major yield hub on Arbitrum, then RDO may do numbers from here. Or the project may face more challenges and RDO never runs. Hard to say, so place any bets accordingly!🫂 friend.techWebsite | Twitter

Aevo just listed FRIEND-PERP, which allows you to long or short FRIEND, an index that tracks the current market cap of social tokens on friend.tech.

Despite your better judgments, are you intrigued by HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu? Perhaps you should also check out the token’s absurd NFT counterpart series, Sproto Gremlins, which are “3,333 unique manifestations of the $BITCOIN egregore.” If you’re wondering what egregore means because you’re not an esoteric wizard, it’s a “non-physical entity that arises from the collective thoughts of a distinct group of people.” So let me help you get this straight… Sprotos are digital manifestations of the nonphysical HarryPotterObama spirit entity that itself has been manifested by sh*tcoin traders. Just another day in crypto. Why it’s a degen play:
On the shoulders of the $BITCOIN surge, Sprotos have captured attention in recent months at a time when many NFT PFP projects have faded into the background. If the HarryPotterObama spirit gods continue to smile on us with more good tidings for $BITCOIN, these Gremlins have a chance to be the associated alpha play in the NFT ecosystem in kind for the duration of the bullishness. It does seem unlikely this collection will have staying power beyond this current absurdity meta, but on the flip side we should expect the unexpected these days in the cryptoeconomy.

Despite your better judgments, are you intrigued by HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu? Perhaps you should also check out the token’s absurd NFT counterpart series, Sproto Gremlins, which are “3,333 unique manifestations of the $BITCOIN egregore.” If you’re wondering what egregore means because you’re not an esoteric wizard, it’s a “non-physical entity that arises from the collective thoughts of a distinct group of people.” So let me help you get this straight… Sprotos are digital manifestations of the nonphysical HarryPotterObama spirit entity that itself has been manifested by sh*tcoin traders. Just another day in crypto. Why it’s a degen play:
On the shoulders of the $BITCOIN surge, Sprotos have captured attention in recent months at a time when many NFT PFP projects have faded into the background. If the HarryPotterObama spirit gods continue to smile on us with more good tidings for $BITCOIN, these Gremlins have a chance to be the associated alpha play in the NFT ecosystem in kind for the duration of the bullishness. It does seem unlikely this collection will have staying power beyond this current absurdity meta, but on the flip side we should expect the unexpected these days in the cryptoeconomy.

Ajna Finance is a governance-minimized lending protocol that does not depend on external price feeds, like an oracle. The protocol enables the creation of permissionless lending markets for any ERC-20 (fungible tokens) and permissionless borrow markets for any ERC-20 and any ERC-721 (NFTs).Instead of relying on oracles, Ajna uses an internal order book that makes lenders set the value of their assets. Ajna can be accessed through third-party interfaces, like Summer.fi.Why it’s a degen play:

📅 Weekly Recap
1. FTX gets approval to sell assets
FTX received permission from a US Court in Delaware on Wednesday to begin liquidating its cryptocurrency assets. 
Previously, the bankrupt exchange had informed the Court that it intended to tap Galaxy Digital as an investment advisor; Wednesday's approval will allow the engagement to commence. While two individual FTX customers objected to the sale and voiced concerns that it may crash crypto prices, the proposal received support from official and ad hoc committees representing creditors.
Galaxy Digital will be allowed to offload up to $100M of Bitcoin, Ether, and specific insider-affiliated tokens per week, a limit that can be increased to $200M by order of the Court. To maximize the recovery proceeds, FTX is also allowed to hedge positional risk (i.e., purchase puts and calls on approved assets) and can utilize staking solutions to earn additional yield. 
According to a Monday court filing, FTX held $3.4B in type ""A"" digital assets, of which $1.16B (34%) is SOL and $560M (16%) is BTC.

Crypto initially dumped on the news, but asset prices have rebounded given the relatively small amount of majors that need to be liquidated and the lockups that remain on FTX's Solana and Aptos bags, which were acquired through early-stage venture investments.
2. SEC goes after Stoner Cats
On Wednesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced charges against the Stoner Cats NFT collection for conducting an unregistered offering of crypto asset securities.
Stoner Cats collected $8.2M in mint fees in 2021 and used the proceeds to create an animated web series. Holders of the NFT received exclusive access to six online episodes featuring well-known actors, including Jane Fonda, Mila Kunis, Ashton Kutcher, Seth MacFarlane and Chris Rock.
Stoner Cats 2 LLC (SC2), the entity behind the Stoner Cats project, did not admit to or deny the findings and chose to settle with the SEC, but under the terms of the agreement, SC2 will pay a $1M fine, and destroy any NFTs that remain in its possession.
Concerningly, the SEC indicated that it charged SC2 for touting the benefits of NFT ownership (i.e., liquidity offered by secondary markets), highlighting the project team's expertise, and implementing a royalty fee. Such features are standard among many NFT collections, and crypto participants are now concerned that the order exposes US-based projects to further regulatory headwinds.
via Twitter
Commissioners Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda dissented from the decision, urging the agency to create guidelines for artists looking to experiment with NFTs instead of bringing arbitrary enforcement actions against projects.
3. Arbitrum partners with Espresso
Offchain Labs, the team behind Arbitrum, announced a partnership with Espresso Systems to bring shared sequencing solutions to the Arbitrum ecosystem. 
Both teams are working together to incorporate the Espresso Sequencer into the Arbitrum stack, and their implementation will use Timeboost, a transaction ordering system proposed by Offchain Labs that improves on the ""first-come, first-serve"" ordering policy currently used on Arbitrum and other L2s, like Optimism.
Today, MEV extraction on L2s is underpinned by latency racing dynamics and powerful actors are incentivized to co-locate with the sequencer to have their transactions received and executed ahead of the competition.
Timeboost will mitigate latency racing dynamics by allowing users to pay priority fees to have their transactions ordered ahead of those received first by the sequencer, allowing globally decentralized actors to partake in MEV extraction on Arbitrum.
4. Binance departures keep coming
Binance.US and its CEO Brian Shroder parted ways on Tuesday last week after the embattled CEX was forced to slash the size of its workforce for the second time in 2023.
Approximately one hundred employees – one-third of US staff – were let go in this latest round of cuts. The mass exodus was followed by the resignations of the exchange's Head of Legal and Chief Risk Officer.
Binance has been plagued by top US and international executives' departures since March, when the Commodity Future Trading Commission (CFTC) fired the first enforcement action barrage at the CEX and top executives for violating the Commodities and Exchange Act and other CFTC regulations.
Not to be outdone, Gary Gensler and the SEC followed up with 13 additional charges three months later against Binance for numerous violations of US securities laws. The US Department of Justice is rumored to be weighing charges against Binance but is reportedly concerned an indictment could cause an FTX-style bank run.
5. Deutsche gets serious on crypto
Last Thursday, Deutsche Bank – Germany's largest investment bank – unveiled a partnership with Taurus, a Swiss-based provider of digital asset infrastructure, to establish crypto custody and asset tokenization service.
Deutsche has planned on offering its clients crypto custody and prime brokerage services since at least 2021, and this partnership should come as no surprise for those who have followed the bank. Previously, Deutsche participated in Taurus's $65M Series B raise in February and applied for a digital crypto custody license from German financial regulator BaFin in June.
TradFi banks, including Standard Chartered, BNY Mellon, and Societe Generale, already offer their clients crypto custody services; Deutsche is just the latest to throw its hat into the ring.

-Bankless team

The crypto landscape experienced a tumultuous journey in the past 21 months. The onset of a bear market in early 2022 left its mark on almost every project, especially Solana.
Throughout 2022, Solana contended with challenges such as network outages and the downfall of FTX. The market capitalization of SOL plummeted by ~93% during that year, accompanied by a 96% reduction in the network's TVL. As the year drew to a close, the outlook for Solana entering 2023 was far from optimistic, and speculations about an impending death spiral were widespread.
Despite facing numerous challenges in the past, Solana's future appears bright.
The narrative surrounding network performance and outages has shifted for the better. Solutions like local fee markets have helped improve network uptime while also contributing to the value accrual of Solana's native token SOL. Advancements like state compression and compressed NFTs are ushering in new use cases while catalysts for growth, including grant initiatives and the emergence of Solang, Neon EVM, and AI, are on the horizon.
Below, let's dig deeper into the health and prospects of Solana.
The Present
Network Status

Through 2023, the prevailing narrative surrounding ""outages"" has shifted. Apart from a momentary network interruption caused by an abnormal consensus bug in February, Solana has maintained 100% uptime year-to-date, and there has been a consistent upward trajectory in total daily transactions.
The improved network performance is the result of the remedies introduced to tackle the issue of network spamming that originated from Gulfstream, Solana's alternative to the mempool for managing pending transactions. The network upgrades included QUIC, Stake-Weighted Quality of Service (QOS), and local fee markets (priority fees). 

Priority fees have raised the barrier to entry for spamming the network. The integration of these fees has proven instrumental in eradicating Solana's historical downtime problems, primarily attributable to suboptimal transaction handling.
Through 2023, approximately 42% of daily fees have been contributed by users who choose to prioritize their transactions. This average is poised to escalate as more wallets and applications incorporate priority fees, mirroring platforms such as Jupiter, Solflare Wallet, and Phantom.
Furthermore, priority fees have only partially played a role in eradicating downtimes. They have also exerted a driving force behind revenue generation, resulting in enhanced value accrual. The revenue directed to the protocol (in SOL) has increased ~42% compared to the previous year.
Given that Solana burns 50% of all transaction fees, priority fees also serve as an additional positive force for value accrual. Following a sharp decline of 92% throughout 2022, the market capitalization of SOL has demonstrated a resurgence of ~111% year-to-date despite the downward pressure stemming from the SEC's recent allegations characterizing SOL as a security.
Ecosystem Highlights
What about the state of the Solana DeFi ecosystem following its setback during the FTX collapse in late 2022?

TVL expressed in USD has experienced a resurgence year-to-date, marking growth of 41%. However, when denominated in SOL, TVL has declined by ~26%, indicating that the rise in TVL has predominantly come from asset price appreciation in USD.

Nevertheless, it's worth noting that liquid staking derivatives (LSDs) have played a substantial role in bolstering Solana and its DeFi landscape throughout 2023. While they have been omitted from the TVL statistics above to prevent double counting, platforms such as Marinade Finance, Lido, and Jito have all achieved remarkable triple-digit increases in their TVL. As a result, they now secure positions within the top 10 in terms of TVL.
While the expansion of DeFi continues to be a central objective for the Solana ecosystem, a discernible transition in user engagement has been observed, with a shift from DeFi towards a broader array of applications. This encompasses domains such as NFTs, gaming, and various consumer-oriented sectors.
The drivers?
In April, the Solana Foundation unveiled state compression, an economical approach for onchain data storage. The implementation of state compression was first observed in the NFT space, developed through a collaborative effort involving Metaplex, Solana Labs, and other key ecosystem contributors. Compressed NFTs come at a reduced expense compared to their uncompressed counterparts.

Following this development, Dialect, a messaging platform, and Access, an application designed for content creator monetization, adopted state compression for compressed NFTs. These applications quickly garnered user interest, leading to a combined average monthly transaction count in the range of several hundred thousand.

Furthermore, Tensor unveiled its compressed NFT marketplace, furnishing users with the capability to trade, list, and place bids on compressed NFTs. The marketplace has captured a substantial portion of transaction volume, accounting for approximately 40% of market share year-to-date.

In the aftermath of the FTX upheaval, Twitter became a breeding ground for speculations suggesting that the momentum behind Solana's development was dead and an exodus of core Solana developers was imminent.
However, despite experiencing a more marked decline in August, available data indicates that the count of GitHub developer repositories has largely persisted year-over-year, and the preconceived rumors of a mass exodus heading into 2023 were exaggerated.
The Future
So, what factors are poised to sustain the positive trajectory of the Solana network and its encompassing ecosystem? Several considerations are on the horizon, including:
Neon EVM: Solana's Neon EVM went live in July. This development enables Ethereum-based applications to operate on Solana without changes to their existing codebase.Solang - In July, Solana Labs unveiled Hyperledger Solang. This new compiler enables developers to build projects on the Solana network using Solidity, thereby bridging the divide between EVM developers and the Solana ecosystem.Eclipse - Eclipse aims to combine the Ethereum ecosystem and Solana's execution environment. 
With the above as potential gateways, there could be room for growth in Solana development and user activity through network effects. 
Move: Although still in its preliminary stages, the introduction of Move as a smart contract language on Solana has the potential to stimulate additional developer engagement within the Solana ecosystem.
The Solana ecosystem is also set to receive capital injections from recently launched growth initiatives, including:
Convertible Grants: The Solana Foundation recently introduced convertible grants to bolster projects within the Solana ecosystem. This mechanism transforms into investments should projects meet specific milestones and growth targets.AI: The Solana Foundation recently launched a $10 million AI grant fund, and the expansion of the ecosystem into the realm of AI may be on the horizon.
Finally, details have recently emerged regarding the assets held on FTX's balance sheet:
FTX - Recent court rulings concerning FTX token sales will safeguard against a flood of market sales of SOL since liquidations will be subject to volume limits.
Conclusion
The network's consistent 100% uptime, bolstered by priority fees that fuel value accrual, combined with an evolving ecosystem marked by technical breakthroughs like state compression, relegates the network's past performance issues and the FTX crisis to the background. Upcoming catalysts, including grant initiatives, Solang, Neon EVM, and the emergence of AI, hold promise on the horizon.

While much of the regulatory assault against Binance has been concentrated in the US, the exchange has also experienced difficulties obtaining licenses or operating across numerous jurisdictions, including Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Cyprus, Holland, and Germany. Stateside, things aren’t looking great. Unlike the frivolous assaults against DeFi protocols and exchanges who have “failed to comply” with an unwritten set of rules, Binance has been targeted for what regulators perceive as a willful disregard of established laws.The first sign of trouble came in February when stablecoin issuer Paxos received a Wells notice from the SEC regarding its Binance USD (BUSD) issuance. Simultaneously, New York’s NYDFS agency ordered Paxos to cease the issuance of the stablecoin. While the subtext of these orders is unknown, it was a concerning development.In March, the CFTC filed an enforcement action against the exchange for willfully circumventing internal compliance policies to onboard prohibited persons. The CFTC’s complaint cites numerous instances where Binance’s compliance staff provided white glove service to illegally onboard “VIP” US customers to the international platform and references multiple transactions related to terror groups and illicit finance – also, not so good.Not one to sit out an opportunity to assault crypto, the SEC followed up with its enforcement action in June, charging Binance with violating US securities laws and misusing customer funds. This set of accusations suggested that Binance diverted US user funds to CZ-owned entities and artificially inflated trading volumes. As one component of its complaint, the SEC cited $190M in customer funds transferred from Binance.US into the bank account of the CZ-controlled Sigma Chain; this account later spent $11M to finance the purchase of a yacht.Binance CEO CZ, one of crypto’s most influential and combative figures, often shares a singular response to such accusations – 4.Too lazy to even post 4.

Focus on building.— CZ 🔶 Binance (@cz_binance) September 26, 2023
CZ stans have certainly been sympathetic to this response, and a history of frivolous US enforcement actions against crypto protocols from the CFTC and SEC has diminished the merit of these accusations against Binance; however, it appears that more trouble is still on the horizon.The Department of Justice is rumored to be weighing a suit against the exchange. Still, prosecutors have so far held off on filing charges, allegedly worried that a Binance indictment could cause a catastrophic FTX-style bank run. Then, this week, the Wall Street Journal provided an update to the case, reporting that the years-long investigation could result in criminal charges and billions in fines against Binance and top executives.Unlike civil enforcement agencies, the DOJ is responsible for criminal enforcement, meaning potential penalties under the DOJ regime are much more severe than those of other regulators and could include imprisonment.🧐 What Could Happen?If recent reports are to be believed, the Department of Justice has done its homework. Should the DOJ decide to throw the book at Binance as the WSJ suggests could occur, what happens?While Semafor’s report floated the government concerns of an FTX-style bank run, Binance has always maintained its solvency, but users have to take its word for it, even with its so-called proof of reserves system, which, yes, proves a user’s assets are held within the platform but fails to provide insight into Binance’s liabilities or accounting practices. At the very least, crypto will be in for a chaotic couple of months should Binance’s operations be impacted by the DOJ. While we don’t want to wander too deep into hypotheticals, Binance has processed 42% of spot trading volumes this month, and the CEX is the dominant source of crypto liquidity. Should this liquidity dissipate or evaporate overnight, market participants would likely rush to dump their bags into illiquid conditions, further depressing prices in their flight toward the exit.Crypto critics would undoubtedly be proclaiming the end of the industry, but we’re not worried! Crypto is not dependent on asset prices or any single organization's efforts to succeed. Opaque, all-powerful CEXs aren’t why crypto is here. When users realize the stakes, they often flee to more transparent platforms. After the collapse of FTX, for example, the ratio of users transacting on DEXs over their centralized counterparts surged.Decentralized systems are resilient to collapse by design and are intended to weather any storm!

I'd rather wait for retail to come back, and then bet big on altcoins.— The DeFi Investor 🔎 (@TheDeFinvestor) September 25, 2023
Modern portfolio theory and common sense tell us that we shouldn't simply seek returns but risk-adjusted returns. This means that for each additional unit of risk we take (such as buying an altcoin), we should expect an additional return over safer assets. In other words, if we choose to invest in a riskier project than Bitcoin or Ethereum, it damn well better offer superior returns. Or else, what's the point?The problem is that most projects simply won't outperform these assets. Still not convinced? Let's look at some data.2019 vs. todayIf you've been paying close attention, no doubt you've seen folks drawing parallels between today's market conditions and those of 2019. It was a bear market, a pre-halvening year, and a pre-election year (for the U.S.). And while a perfect 1:1 comparison doesn't exist, we can use the 2019 market to help understand how the crypto market could progress from here.I'm going to take you back to the fall of 2019. Brexit was top-of-mind, with crypto taking a subdued back seat. BTC was trading at just over $8K, with ETH under $200. Tether was sitting around $4B in supply, and Bitcoin forks BCH and BSV still occupied the Top 10 spots. If you were around in 2019, did you think of picking up any of these projects?CoinMarketCap historical snapshot from fall 2019, sourceSurvivorship bias can cloud your judgment when you look back at these times - so let's be objective here. If you were to pick some random projects out of the top 200 by market cap, how would they have fared? Would we have been better off sticking with ETH or BTC?Looking into the performance of the top 200 assets by market cap from September 2019 to the approximate all-time high for BTC (November of 2021), we see some sobering results. In the chart below, projects that outperformed ETH will be visible above the red horizontal line.Relative performance of Top 200 assets against ETH from Sept 2019 to Nov 2021's ATHIn total, just 15 of the top 200 performed better than ETH (40 against BTC), showing how strong survivorship bias has become in our sector. You may notice that the dots become sparser as we walk down the market cap rankings (left to right). Why? It's simple. Projects die.Of the 200 projects observed in the 2019 snapshot, 63% were no longer in the top 200 in November 2021. Crypto markets are just capitalism dialed up to 11, with no mercy for weak projects.""But this time is different.""There's no doubt there are more legitimate crypto projects today than in 2019. But look at today's top 50 and ask yourself, how many of these have sufficient product-market fit to last years or decades from now?Only Bitcoin and Ethereum (so far) have proven their stickiness over multiple cycles, with increasing users, volume, and integrations year after year. The list of ""low"" risk investments in crypto may grow over the years (and you probably have some candidates earmarked already), but that simply isn't the case today.Many of the previous bull market winners did not even exist during the doldrums of the 2019 bear. Big-time investors that poured millions into seed rounds wanted to avoid launching tokens during bearish times. And who's to say this time will have a different playbook?There's a strong chance that the best performing tokens next cycle haven't been released yet.

That's why it's so important to keep unallocated stables reserved.

Found a diamond in the rough?Say you are part of the 10% who love getting into the weeds and finding gems. Finding undervalued projects requires sufficient due diligence. Do you think the folks who made altcoin picks in 2019 all picked the 15/200 that outperformed ETH? Or would they have been better served by HODLing the majors?You may think you've found the next big thing, and perhaps you're right. But remember to keep tabs on these smaller projects, as their fundamentals often shift much faster than the majors.Is the team delivering on their roadmap?Are Key Performance Indicators trending in the right direction?Are they on the path to achieving product market fit?Are any of your invalidation criteria getting triggered?Becoming involved in project communities can be exciting, especially in times of bear market building. It's when all the tourists have checked out, and only true enthusiasts remain.But remember – don't marry your altcoin bags, and when in doubt, stick to the majors.Action steps⛰️ Read Is this the Last Cycle?🪙 Read yesterday's article Unpacking ETH's Wall Street Debut",https://www.bankless.com/maybe-you-should-stick-to-the-majors-2,2023-10-04T00:00:00.000Z,https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/2023/10/lu.ma._two_grand_MLB_baseball_hitters_at_the_same_mound_both_wi_e799e759-1b3b-4703-966b-a2bd6e08ef4b-2.jpg,563,Bankless,blog,Unknown Error,

Twitter/X is still a massive hub for the crypto community, but what will it take for crypto to buy the web3 vision it is selling? Today, we take a deeper look at Farcaster and its prospects. - Bankless team In an otherwise down year for crypto, the ecosystem’s crypto social plays have seemed to be making some forward progress in 2023. By “crypto social,” I mean the web3 apps centered around social connections. For example, friend.tech burst onto the scene recently with its crypto-native version of super chats, i.e., buy the keys of your favorite people to get hotlines to their DMs. via friend.tech I’ve enjoyed this use case a lot, and I applaud friend.tech’s popularization of the PWA mobile stack, but the catch here is not everyone has enough ETH to shell over for their favorite people. This year, another attractive crypto social riser has been Lens, a web3 social graph protocol focused on data portability so users can enjoy a range of Lens-powered apps, e.g., Orb, Hey, Tape, etc. via Lens I think that the vision for Lens V2, which will boast profiles as wallets via ERC-6551 and the whole gamut of web3 activities thanks to Open Actions, is brilliant. The catch here is Lens V2 hasn’t launched yet, and there’s still a waitlist in place for V1 for now. The other big crypto social project making waves lately is Farcaster. It’s in the news now because its permissionless sign-ups just went live. Account creation is managed on the Optimism L2, so it’s very affordable to sign up. And like Lens, Farcaster is a protocol for supporting decentralized apps, so you have a range of different ways you can play with Farcaster. Of course, this decentralized approach to portability is the keystone of Farcaster’s design, as it enforces user control over data (a foil to web2 platform data silos) and fosters permissionless app development (a foil to centralized “walled garden” app stores). via Farcaster Yet what does this decentralized design look like in practice? Speaking from personal experience, years ago, I was banned from my favorite Ethereum-centric subreddit for sharing one of my write-ups, which moderators there must have seen as spammy. But the ban turned me off from Reddit, and I haven’t been back since. I had a lot of activity racked up on that original account, and it’d be nice to port that data over to a different social media platform so I can keep building upon it, but I can’t since it’s siloed to Reddit. In contrast, Farcaster is an open protocol upon which many different crypto social apps can be built. One such app is flink.fyi, a Reddit-like web-only client for Farcaster. It’s dominating sign-ups at the time of writing, likely thanks to its familiar UI and its affordable ~$7 yearly fee. Flink.fyi The thing is, let’s say I grow tired of Flink’s UI, or its development stagnates over time, or what have you. Then, I could just move over to a different Farcaster app, e.g., the popular Twitter-like Warpcast, and still enjoy building on the same continued social graph. That sort of portability is incredibly compelling to me as a user, as I don’t want my social graph to be trapped on a single platform or hostage to the whims of a single person like Elon Musk on X. Warpcast UI With Farcaster, you can opt in and opt out of apps as you please, all while maintaining your underlying social data intact onchain – a utility I don’t take for granted after watching the Twitter takeover debacle. Sure, Musk can commandeer X accounts any time he wants, but he can't pry my ENS name as plugged into the Farcaster ecosystem! That is the power and promise of crypto social, radical user empowerment. As a web3 system, Farcaster can also be a springboard for user adventure in crypto. For example, consider how Warpcast has a dedicated Nouns channel or how it surfaces NFT mints in a way that traditional social media platforms have shown no stomach for to date. Warpcast UI So whether I zoom in or zoom out, yes, I do think something like Farcaster can be a big catalyst for the crypto social scene going forward. It supports the unique experiences and data ownership that crypto-natives long for while also being wide open enough to support the creation of apps that can appeal to even wider audiences beyond just crypto adventurers. Bullish. If you’re keen to take the leap, now you can! Sign up for your app of choice, like Warpcast or Flink, at farcaster.xyz/apps. Just remember, sign-ups are managed on Optimism, so you’ll need a little bit of ETH on that L2 to complete the necessary account creation transaction.

95e44ad4a13cabfd626e0955dc78985111326c54a3e04b241109d682b059b40a,David's Take: 5 Big Questions Facing Crypto's Future,"Unanswered questions ft. Superchains, LSTs, Solana and more",,"#4: Does Solana get gobbled? Do Solana and Ethereum grow as independent ecosystems, or do the lines between these meld? If they meld, how much gravitational weight does Ethereum have over Solana? Long-time Bankless listeners will know my thoughts here. No one has been able to effectively refute my Empire Model for Blockchains, and a bunch of similar theses ( Fat Protocol, L1s are Money ) are all in alignment with it. L1s are in heated competition for total dominance, and in the fullness of time, one blockchain will ultimately gobble up all the others. 'Tis the nature of open source systems, especially when you add the jet fuel of economic incentives. Solana has stood out to me versus its competitors. It's not an L1 fork of the EVM, in which any value it creates ultimately just flows back to the Ethereum ecosystem. It's not Cosmos, with no actual settlement layer or enshrined L1 currency. It's not Bitcoin, with all the non-BTC value stripped and deleted. Solana has its VM, scaling strategy, and L1 asset: SOL. Solana's entire tech stack is not Ethereum, placing it as far away from Ethereum's gravitational pull as possible. This strategy makes sense to me since Ethereum appears to gobble up everything in its sphere. The best chance for survival for any non-Ethereum L1 is to be far away from Ethereum's influence. Nevertheless, Solana does not live in a vacuum. Eclipse is porting the Solana virtual machine to Ethereum, taking Solana's execution and settling it on the much larger settlement network: Ethereum. Chris Burniske thinks Solana can retain its autonomy and that Eclipse is a ""Solana Embassy"" on Ethereum. Eclipse is like a @Solana Embassy in #Ethereum-nation. https://t.co/mc1N8i8hsy — Chris Burniske (@cburniske) September 21, 2023 I think Eclipse is ""Solana tech committing treason"" against SOL's value and defecting to join the Ethereum monetary network and settlement layer. Eclipse fulfills the ETH-maxi thesis that all good technology ultimately finds its way to Ethereum, especially when it's just an execution layer, a layer free to detach from a minority settlement layer to join the more global one. So, what does the future have in store? Can Solana maintain its boundaries? Can Solana's components successfully incentivize itself to remain inside its borders and not engage in network polyamory? Or, is it more true that no matter how far away an L1 is from Ethereum's gravitational weight, eventually Ethereum will gobble you up too, and the earlier you can defect from the minority network to defect to the majority network, the better off you'll be? How strong is the incentive to defect to Ethereum? I think in the future, we'll be able to look back and see evidence that gives points towards both sides. Both sides will be able to say, ""We were right."" But one side will be more right than the other, and anyone who's listened to Bankless knows where I fall on this debate.","Ethereum is now eight years old, and I've been around for 6 of those years. Never before has the path forward been more clear – we've come a long way since we thought writing tweets on the L1 would change the world! We now know what decentralized crypto-networks are good for and how to scale them. There's so much valuable juice left to squeeze from our current understanding of crypto-networks. It's exciting!Nevertheless, there are plenty of unanswered questions about what the endgame for crypto looks like. While the fog of war is slowly receding, it is still very present.Making capital allocation decisions, both personally and in my VC duties, depends on the answers to some of the big questions left in this space, of which there are plenty. All the VCs and builders in crypto are trying to answer the big questions more precisely and quickly than their competition.I've taken time to identify some of the biggest questions left in the space and how I think about them. So, Bankless Nation, here are five big unanswered questions about the future of crypto.  Many Superchains or one Uberchain?Where is value captured in the Rollup Stack?Where does LST equilibrium lie?Does Solana get gobbled?How do we get price discovery onchain?This post is a monster, filled with an awful lot of questions – so strap in.⚠️ Disclosures: I am an investor in a handful of projects mentioned or alluded to below, including Optimism. You can see my full, up-to-date list of disclosures and those from Bankless Ventures here.#1: Many Superchains or one Uberchain?We know how Ethereum will scale. Rollups have extrapolated Ethereum's WWIII-resistant blockspace into an abundance of L2 blockspace. In 2020 and 2021, we talked about this in theory, and in 2022 and 2023, we've seen it go into production.But there are so many teams executing on this same vision in their own unique ways. The Optimism Superchain! Arbitrum Orbits! zkSync's ZK Stack! Polygon Supernets! Eclipse! There are sooo many different ways to build an L2!Each represents a strategy for extending Ethereum L1 blockspace into the furthest reaches of the internet. My perceived endgame for crypto is that a blockchain finds its way into every corner of the internet, and Ethereum is producing various blockchain genes, each specializing uniquely, to fill the chainless voids of the internet.But questions remain:Do we need so many different rollup standards? Or does just one framework work? Does my Empire Model for Blockchains naturally extend into an ""Empire Model for L2s on Ethereum?""Or does Ethereum's Rollup-Centric Roadmap inherently lower the barrier to entry for alternative rollup standards, producing a more pluralist equilibrium of rollup strategies?Can app-specific rollups (roll-apps) justify themselves economically?Or is it likely that the economics converge all applications to live on a few dominant rollups?Will economic and composability incentives force converge upon a single monolithic Ethereum rollup, as illustrated as one of the outcomes in Vitalik's Endgame?What properties can we predict this theoretical winner would have today?Few rollups?Rollups have costs, and only some use cases can justify the costs of establishing and maintaining a rollup network based on their economics alone. These applications will have to find a home on a more generalized landscape, and generalized rollups will compete to provide the largest amount of real estate for the cheapest cost.This argument captures some composability tailwinds as well. When more applications live on the same chain, optionality increases. The whole becomes greater than the sum of the parts, and the more parts, the greater the whole. Humans naturally migrate to cities, and rollup economics are the same. Who can build the biggest city?The Eclipse team has been hard at work for the past year, and we've had to learn a lot of lessons firsthand along the way.

These are my reflections on why there likely won't be millions of rollups, and what guided us to the Eclipse Mainnet SVM L2:https://t.co/lshKzWuzNf— neel (@neelsalami) October 2, 2023
Neel Samani of the Eclipse team is in the ""few rollups"" camp and gives his reasoning here:Many rollups?As technology develops, it becomes cheaper! The fixed costs of rollup deployment will decrease over time as the tech matures.While having to contend with infinite rollups seems untenable, additional areas of research and innovation can help contain this. Homogenous blockspace, abstraction layers, cross-chain execution, contract calls, shared sequencing, and offchain intents will all contribute to corralling the chaos of 10,000 chains.Having every application live together on one chain is admirable, but there are fundamental limits to scale for monolithic chains. While horizontal scaling via many rollups seems chaotic, plenty of research and development is left to squeeze on multiple fronts.Divergent paths?The idea of the Superchain future for Ethereum is compelling, but it doesn't exactly solve L2 composability.Ethereum's rollup-centric roadmap produces a path towards infinite scaling by simply allowing chains to be deployed as needed to Ethereum. If one L2 gets congested, just spin up another! But this strategy presents new problems for Ethereum that the Solana community would just love to tell you about – mainly composability issues.Rollup SDKs like the OP Stack help solve this problem. Shared standards and homogenous blockspace are a huge first step to recomposing different chains back together into one single execution layer, but this time with infinite scale. Add in some shared execution, cross-chain contract calls, some UI abstraction, that magical '???' step, and boom, we have an infinite scale for an L2 Superchain.There's just one problem. Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon, and zkSync all want to do this. A path forwardIt's great if the Optimism Superchain is 1,000 different chains perceived as one, but Arbitrum still speaks a different language as Optimism, as do all the rest of the L2 SDKs.This is why Arbitrum's version of a Superchain doesn't look like Optimism's. Arbitrum is interested in the single unified Uberchain vision, in which universal composability mechanisms tie together any and every chain.Rather than producing yet another Superchain, Arbitrum is working in the space between these chains. This area of focus is the interoperability layer between the Ethereum L1 and the settlement of a Superchain. Once a Superchain agrees upon its internal state, Arbitrum wants to focus RnD efforts on inter-chain settlement before collective finality is found by posting to the L1.It's a compelling vision, and if you squint, you'll see that the above two sections are actually the same. There's potentially a future in which many rollups exist, and chain composability technology innovations allow them to blend and blur together into one single Uberchain. Or... those technologies don't work, and the only way to achieve true seamless composability is by just having one single rollup.So, is the future of Ethereum...A handful of different multi-chain economic zones? (Superchains!)A single composable Uberchain? (Superchains + cross-chain composability innovations!)A single monolithic rollup?Place your bets! 🎲#2: Where is value captured in the Rollup Stack?Each L2 team wants to propagate their Chain-Development Kit across the crypto landscape. There's the OP Stack, ZK Stack, Supernets, Orbits, and surely more to follow.Why do they make these things? How do L2s benefit from more carbon-copy deployments of their chain? Since forking is permissionless, how do the L2 tokens capture value when forking is free? The process of forking forks out the token. Why would a forked OP-Stack chain willingly pay fees to the OP Collective? What's the incentive?Mantle, one of the largest OP Stack forks, forked an older version of the codebase and stated they currently have no plans to join the incoming Optimism Superchain. They're going to keep their sequencer fees for themselves, thank you very much.Meanwhile, Base is contributing 15% of its sequencer fees to the Optimism Collective, effectively the OP token. So Base, as an OP-Stack fork, is contributing value to OP, but Mantle isn't.What gives? What's the difference between these two chains? The answer: Governance. Without governance, we have disparate, chaotic, messy chains-on-chains-on-chains. With governance, we have homogenous blockspace, code reuse, and shared upgradability. With these properties, we have the foundation to begin fusing 10,000+ messy chains into a chainless user experience.This has been why I've been uniquely compelled by Optimism's strategy and roadmap above all others. Ben, Jing, Karl, and the Optimism team ran through the Ethereum scaling idea maze and arrived at the logical conclusion of governance far before any other team, and have been ""taking the hard path"" of figuring out decentralized governance from Day 1. All other rollups are competing on technical advantages, but eventually, that will run out, and they'll have to start figuring out their long-term governance strategy once they arrive at that logical conclusion.Meanwhile, the OP-stack can just absorb the best tech developed by others while working on digging an unforkable moat of governance since, before, any other L2 team was privy to it.""Why is governance the logical conclusion for rollup competition?"" is a vast subject that's out of scope for this article. I'll have to point you toward the very deep Optimism rabbit hole to figure that one out.This is my thesis for how the L2 space plays out: L2 token value capture is ultimately derived from governance effectiveness. Nonetheless, here are the questions I still have about this:Will a generalized, modular framework like the OP stack be able to absorb the best L2 tech in the same way we've seen the Ethereum L1 absorb peripheral technologies?How powerful can the incentive to join the Superchain get? This question is a proxy for measuring 'governance effectiveness'; how effective can L2 governance become? Will it become sufficient to cohere a bunch of messy chains together?If cross-chain composability innovations don't produce what's needed to create a chainless experience, what other factors can governance leverage to increase L2 token value capture?But what about Rollup infra providers?Governance is only half of the L2 value capture equation. Even if L2 SDKs can figure out token value capture, they'll still have to contend with the ""RaaS-sized hole in their business model.""Most rollups have a RaaS-sized hole in their business model.

Some thoughts on the challenge that rollup frameworks face today, and why they should use M&A to solve it. 🧵— Myles O'Neil (@MylesOneil) August 7, 2023
If we think there will be lots of L2 rollups, then that means there will need to be infrastructure to host all of these rollups. Think: Cloud, but for rollup infra.This is why companies like Conduit and Caldera have emerged. They want to host as many rollups as possible to capture some of the fees that rollups produce.Rollups-as-a-Service like Conduit are in a thumb war with L2 SDKs like the OP-Stack. RaaSs want fees, and the L2s also want fees. Where's the equilibrium?There are two outcomes I see:RaaS Providers want all the fees and will attempt to thwart L2 teams by routing around them.RaaS Providers will accept that they are beholden to L2 teams and will simply receive whatever fees they are given.I'm L2-biased here, so this reasoning could be checked, but here's how I see it. Say the RaaS Provider is maximally greedy and wants #1.RaaS Provider: ""We have all the infra; why do we need to pay taxes to the software when the software is free to fork?""So, RaaS Providers just take the OP-Stack and help teams deploy OP-Stack chains using their RaaS, and they collect the sequencer fees of all of the chains they operate, and the L2 tokens get NOTHING. They might even unlock some chain composability benefits by helping all their chains shared-sequence with each other.The problem here is that we return to the governance problem. Producing a plethora of chains is not a sufficient outcome, and while having a single RaaS provider unlocks some shared sequencing benefits, it's not nearly enough to produce a chain-abstracted outcome that the Superchain endgame requires to be successful. If a RaaS wants to attempt to win a thumb war over L2 SDKs, they'll… need to become their own L2 SDK. This means they're entering the Arena of L2 competition, and they'll ultimately find convergence with needing to work on L2 tech innovation, BD, and the big one: governance.How will RaaSs actually decentralize their L2 tech stack if their significant competitive advantage is that they run physical hardware in physical locations? If any RaaS produces a monopoly by running every L2 chain, all L2s are centralized to that one RaaS hosting center. To decentralize, RaaSs will need to work on the same things that all the other L2s have already worked on for years.So, this pushes them into #2. RaaSs will be service providers to L2 teams and will have to compete on fees with other competitive RaaSs, as L2 teams use their anti-trust cudgel of token governance to make sure that no one single RaaS produces a monopoly that gives the RaaS outsized power over the L2 SDK.At least, that's how I see it. So, my question here is: ""Am I right?""#3: Where does LST equilibrium lie?The spectrum: One single dominant LST versus a handful of LSTs in tension with each otherHere, I am conflicted. I understand the compelling arguments that market forces will force convergence upon a single liquid LST. I am not naive to these factors. But I am also not so nihilistic that I'm willing to ""go down easy"" when it comes to forces that run up against very firmly held values and beliefs of the core Ethereum community that protect it. Market forces are not the only thing at play here.Additionally, the dominance of one LST is correlated to the incentive for a subdominant LST to vampire attack it. As one LST gets over its foundations, the desire and power of a vampire attack increases commensurately. This can, at least in the short term, disturb the equilibrium of a dominant LST.The big questions are:How far will the Ethereum community be willing to go to ensure a diversity of LST options?How effective are the tools for suppressing single-LST dominance?If (when?) a single LST does achieve total monopoly, how much does that erode the core of Ethereum values?Does it at all?In answer to this last question, Mike Nueder wrote a fantastic blog post that defines the idea maze of this particular question.excited to share ""Magnitude and direction of Lido attack vectors."" the Lido debate always gets reduced to a false dichotomy of good vs. evil; this piece aims to paint a fuller picture

For me, the value of pluralism is something that deeply attracts me to this space, and I'd like to see more of it wherever possible. Danny Ryan gave the technical argument for why we should uphold that.If we do ultimately converge at a single dominant LST, how fast does it take to get there? Is slower better? – imo, yes. What guardrails can we construct while we have the time?We recently saw a denial of the vote for ARB token incentives towards stETH on Arbitrum, mainly due to the concerns about Lido's dominance over Ethereum. If ""market forces"" were the only thing at play here, this vote should have passed.#4: Does Solana get gobbled?Do Solana and Ethereum grow as independent ecosystems, or do the lines between these meld? If they meld, how much gravitational weight does Ethereum have over Solana?Long-time Bankless listeners will know my thoughts here. No one has been able to effectively refute my Empire Model for Blockchains, and a bunch of similar theses (Fat Protocol, L1s are Money) are all in alignment with it. L1s are in heated competition for total dominance, and in the fullness of time, one blockchain will ultimately gobble up all the others. 'Tis the nature of open source systems, especially when you add the jet fuel of economic incentives.Solana has stood out to me versus its competitors. It's not an L1 fork of the EVM, in which any value it creates ultimately just flows back to the Ethereum ecosystem. It's not Cosmos, with no actual settlement layer or enshrined L1 currency. It's not Bitcoin, with all the non-BTC value stripped and deleted.Solana has its VM, scaling strategy, and L1 asset: SOL. Solana's entire tech stack is not Ethereum, placing it as far away from Ethereum's gravitational pull as possible. This strategy makes sense to me since Ethereum appears to gobble up everything in its sphere. The best chance for survival for any non-Ethereum L1 is to be far away from Ethereum's influence.Nevertheless, Solana does not live in a vacuum. Eclipse is porting the Solana virtual machine to Ethereum, taking Solana's execution and settling it on the much larger settlement network: Ethereum.Chris Burniske thinks Solana can retain its autonomy and that Eclipse is a ""Solana Embassy"" on Ethereum.Eclipse is like a @Solana Embassy in #Ethereum-nation. https://t.co/mc1N8i8hsy— Chris Burniske (@cburniske) September 21, 2023
I think Eclipse is ""Solana tech committing treason"" against SOL's value and defecting to join the Ethereum monetary network and settlement layer. Eclipse fulfills the ETH-maxi thesis that all good technology ultimately finds its way to Ethereum, especially when it's just an execution layer, a layer free to detach from a minority settlement layer to join the more global one.So, what does the future have in store? Can Solana maintain its boundaries? Can Solana's components successfully incentivize itself to remain inside its borders and not engage in network polyamory?Or, is it more true that no matter how far away an L1 is from Ethereum's gravitational weight, eventually Ethereum will gobble you up too, and the earlier you can defect from the minority network to defect to the majority network, the better off you'll be?How strong is the incentive to defect to Ethereum?I think in the future, we'll be able to look back and see evidence that gives points towards both sides. Both sides will be able to say, ""We were right."" But one side will be more right than the other, and anyone who's listened to Bankless knows where I fall on this debate.#5: How do we get price discovery onchain?Some of the most exciting deals we've looked at at Bankless Ventures have been around this question. Having price discovery occur onchain rather than through Binance will produce massive tailwinds for the entire industry. Price discovery represents a balance of power between decentralized and centralized systems, and so far, price discovery is a trophy firmly held by the centralized camp.If decentralized systems are going to 'win,' we need that trophy. I want to rip it from the cold, dead hands of Binance. Coinbase, you don't get to have it either. Crypto-economic systems are truth machines, but right now, the source of truth about crypto prices isn't derived from the systems that host the assets. We need to go full ouroboros here. Crypto produces the assets and needs to be the oracle for what their prices are. We're the captain now.At least, that's where we need to be. Various promising mechanisms can help tilt favor toward decentralized systems, but it's unclear how far this will take us. Binance has the benefit of 1-millisecond block-times. No decentralized system will ever be able to keep up with that, and price discovery naturally converges on the most liquid and fastest-updating oracle.How can we get this onchain?Promising innovations that tilt the balance of power lie in the arena of Uniswap Hooks and intents. Intents might be the big unlock here. There is an arena of price discovery that occurs in the space between CEX's and DEX's. This nebulous, undefined space is where market-makers and MEV bots make decisions and execute trades, not on any venue in particular. The space-port of Ethereum needs to become conducive to this plane of existence. We need to build infrastructure that supports trade between onchain DEXs and the infinite variety of spaceships zipping around the space between chains and CEXs so that we can encourage them to be more proximate to us and further away from Binance.So long as our crypto systems live under the shadow of CEX price discovery, we will forever be an inferior version of ourselves. Achieving onchain price discovery will be one of the most significant signals of the maturity and sophistication of our industry.This is a non-negotiable; we need this. This is not ""Can we?"" it's ""How do we?"" Without onchain price discovery, the crypto experiment has failed in some major way.The mechanism that produces onchain price discovery will surely be one of crypto's most valuable pieces of infrastructure. It doesn't have to be a single silver bullet, either! Uniswap and AMMs are a huge asset in the crypto tool belt for producing onchain price discovery, but more mechanisms like this are needed.Who's going to build it, and what does it look like?ConclusionThis article is about questions, not answers. Many other ""questions"" about crypto are being asked in 2023; these are just the first five big ones that come to my mind.How do Ethereum composability and chain abstraction work in the context of its rollup-centric roadmap?Where does value settle in Ethereum's rollup-centric roadmap?How significant is the LST threat to Ethereum, and what does its future have in storeWhat does the future of Ethereum <> Solana relations look like?How do we get price discovery onchain?These are all very big questions that will require some very big answers. Rather than a single bullet for each question, the answers to each likely come in various strategies, mechanisms, and projects. This is why collaboration and communication between Web3 builders is critical; no one is going to solve these problems on their own.Of all the things mentioned here, getting price discovery onchain seems like the most complex and most noble cause, as it's something that's going to plague all crypto systems equally, no matter what tribe you find yourself in.Understanding the idea landscape for how we solve these problems is still something that I'm working on, so I will report back on this once I know more!

Given US regulatory uncertainty, it should come as no surprise that Uniswap Labs has been forced to monetize via a front-end fee rather than leveraging the in-protocol fee switch. Still, this development should spawn serious questions among UNI token holders of whether value will actually accrue to their investment from Uniswap's success!Differing goals between Labs equity holders and UNI token holders could pose a barrier to turning on the in-protocol fee switch in the first place, seeing as some of these actors are one-in-the-same but enjoy greater marginal returns from profits earned via the equity-only front-end fee versus the more diluted in-protocol alternative.The schism created by this decision shines a spotlight on the competition underlying the relationship between token and equity holders. Every dollar of fees extracted from the Uniswap front-end fee is a dollar of potential profitability from token holders (and vice versa).Even if a regulator compliant path for implementing an in-protocol fee switch existed and received approval despite governance roadblocks, it would exist in contention with the front-end fee and be unable to extract maximum value.Further, while UNI holders may control the IP rights of Uniswap's smart contracts, there are unanswered questions about the long-term value of these assets. Uniswap Labs is pivoting away from the AMM to construct Uniswap X, a request for quote (RFQ) system. To provide the best possible price for users, Uniswap X will query the Uniswap pools and unaffiliated third-party fillers (read professional market makers), who then compete to fill swaps using onchain liquidity like AMM pools or their private inventory.Ideally, Uniswap Labs would be fully aligned on a singular goal of providing value to the UNI token; instead, this privately held corporation is siphoning a portion of the profits away from token holders to build products in direct competition with the Uniswap AMM.While crypto tokens serve to align incentives between their issuers and holders, the addition of offchain equity with incompatible incentives only serves to muddy this equation. - Jack",https://www.bankless.com/bull-vs-bear-uni,,https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/2023/10/bullbearuni-2.png,563,Bankless,blog,Unknown Error,

Still, this development should spawn serious questions among UNI token holders of whether value will actually accrue to their investment from Uniswap's success!Differing goals between Labs equity holders and UNI token holders could pose a barrier to turning on the in-protocol fee switch in the first place, seeing as some of these actors are one-in-the-same but enjoy greater marginal returns from profits earned via the equity-only front-end fee versus the more diluted in-protocol alternative.The schism created by this decision shines a spotlight on the competition underlying the relationship between token and equity holders. Every dollar of fees extracted from the Uniswap front-end fee is a dollar of potential profitability from token holders (and vice versa).Even if a regulator compliant path for implementing an in-protocol fee switch existed and received approval despite governance roadblocks, it would exist in contention with the front-end fee and be unable to extract maximum value.Further, while UNI holders may control the IP rights of Uniswap's smart contracts, there are unanswered questions about the long-term value of these assets. Uniswap Labs is pivoting away from the AMM to construct Uniswap X, a request for quote (RFQ) system. To provide the best possible price for users, Uniswap X will query the Uniswap pools and unaffiliated third-party fillers (read professional market makers), who then compete to fill swaps using onchain liquidity like AMM pools or their private inventory.Ideally, Uniswap Labs would be fully aligned on a singular goal of providing value to the UNI token; instead, this privately held corporation is siphoning a portion of the profits away from token holders to build products in direct competition with the Uniswap AMM.While crypto tokens serve to align incentives between their issuers and holders, the addition of offchain equity with incompatible incentives only serves to muddy this equation. - Jack",https://www.bankless.com/bull-vs-bear-uni,,https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/2023/10/bullbearuni-2.png,563,Bankless,blog,Unknown Error,

Still, others feel that Uniswap Labs is simply operating within the regulatory realities of the moment and that they shouldn't be raked over the coals for trying to monetize a startup that is largely responsible for the future success of the protocol.In today's article, Bankless analysts Jack Inabinet and 563 dig into the bear and bull cases for the UNI token.Agree or disagree? Take it to the comments!Let's kick things off with the bull case...🐂 Bull CaseUniswap's complete domination of the decentralized exchange (DEX) sector is already beyond reproach. Responsible for almost 70% of Ethereum swap volume and 44% of total onchain volume, its nearest competitors have been fighting over the remaining scraps for years.Top Ethereum DEXs, by volume, from DeFiLlama""Hooks,"" a new feature in their upcoming fourth iteration, will allow protocols to customize Uniswap pool parameters, enabling a new wave of smart contract experimentation. This change in Uniswap's design encourages newcomers to build on top of Uniswap instead of forking their codebase to make a competitive product. In the land of DEXs, all roads are starting to lead to Uniswap.Hayden's announcement of a front-end fee rustled the feathers of impatient ""experts"" on Crypto Twitter, who would prefer that Uniswap Labs, the main contributor to the protocol, never make a profit. Note that the 0.15% swap fee is less than one-fifth of Metamask's 0.875% – a fee that has propelled Metamask to a level of consistent income that is often reserved for only the most-used chains and apps.Uniswap Labs rearing its head into the top revenue generators, from DeFiLlamaNot to mention that the fee is only relevant to users swapping via Uniswap's front-end. Using an aggregator that touches Uniswap pools? You aren't affected, my friend.This means that people opting for the convenience of Uniswap's front-end (or mobile app) pay roughly $0.15 for each $100 swap. And in the grand scheme of crypto volatility, that's likely to be lost in the noise.Uniswap is in the process of leveraging its advantage in the DEX space, building up a war chest to fund more development, ensuring that its moat deepens, widens, and becomes unassailable. Holding the UNI token is a bet that Uniswap will cement itself as the market leader so that if the coveted ""fee switch"" is ever flipped, it is done from a place of power and not from peer pressure alone. No one expects growth stocks like Google or Tesla to throw off a dividend, why should the UNI token? Sophisticated investors recognize the shortsightedness of this option (hence why a16z voted against it). There is a time and a place for a dividend, but a crypto startup is not Johnson & Johnson.my view on @Uniswap is you're being hypocritical if you smear UNI as just a governance token but would own Nvidia, Google, TSLA, Cloudflare, or any tech stock with no dividend.

By internalizing and compounding profits, Uniswap will be able to continue its growth trajectory, building out new features and a better user experience. Their objective is that the word ""DEX"" becomes synonymous with ""Uniswap,"" and they are well underway towards this goal. And if 0.15% is the price for this level of absolute dominance, it is a small price to pay indeed.- 563🧸 Bear CaseIf you believe that asset speculation is a major crypto use case, you should be bullish on ""Uniswap,"" but the question remains: should you be loading your bags with UNI tokens?Undoubtedly, Uniswap Labs equity HODLers are feeling good about their investments.

I wasn't at the first two Breakpoints, so I'm shooting from the hip a bit here. These are takes I've generated after talking to those who did go to these Breakpoints.Congrats to @SolanaConf for being the only conference that caused a pump instead of a dump— 🩸DavidHoffman.eth🦇🔊 (@TrustlessState) November 1, 2023
The vibe of Solana Breakpoint had notes that I was well familiar with from my early days in Ethereum, but with some unique flavorings as well.First, there was a pretty clear sense that the Solana community feels like they're sitting on gold. They know that they've got something that the world will one day want, and that sense of ""pre-rich conviction"" was definitely present. I wouldn't say this vibe was ubiquitous… it was definitely expressed by a minority. The rest of the conference attendees were more indifferent to that aspect, but it was present nonetheless. This vibe naturally brought a nascent sense of optimism and excitement, which I definitely remember feeling during the novelty of my early Ethereum days, especially during my early years at ETH Denver 2018 and 2019. Solana & EthereumThe content featured on the mainstage was all about 👏 scaling 👏 scaling 👏 scaling 👏. If there's one bit of Solana Breakpoint content to consume to catch the vibe, it's the 90min opening presentation by various Solana leaders. (It was hosted on Halloween, hence Anatoly is in a green dragon costume)Anatoly’s “hard problems” during his opening keynote 😂 pic.twitter.com/4h3RjQBdUL— 🩸DavidHoffman.eth🦇🔊 (@TrustlessState) October 31, 2023
It was pretty funny to hear direct jabs at Ethereum during the keynote presentation. Jokes about ""not needing any layers"" and ""Ethereum alignment"" are actually a pretty core part of the Solana DNA at this point. Here, Crypto Twitter has clearly bled into Solana culture, and it's the part that I find least resonant. Solana's identity has largely been shaped by having to survive post-FTX collapse, all while the Ethereum community twists the knife over the rampant extraction culture in the Solana app-layer and the claimed incoherence of the monolithic scaling strategy. The Ethereum community was not nice to Solana in the time in which Solana was down bad the most. And it was at this moment when the Solana community grit its teeth, dug in, chewed glass, and dug itself out of the narrative shithole it found itself in. The narrative around Solana was so bad that it became existential.VCs stopped funding Solana-based projects just because they were building on Solana. $SOL market cap was at $4B, less than half of the 2018-2019 $ETH market cap bottom of $10, during which Ethereum also was faced with existential concerns about its ability to fund itself. I'm pretty sure that this is when Solana leadership took a direct, hands-on approach to fixing the Solana narrative before it became a self-fulfilling prophecy. This was when the Mert reply-guy ratio army started to kick in, and when you would find Anatoly replying to every single tweet about Solana, good or bad. This was when Solana started developing narratives and memes that could revitalize the community around it. And to their credit, it totally worked. The narrative around Solana has found new meaning, new heights, and an insane level of engagement on Twitter. And to our fault, by attempting to ""finish off"" Solana by conflating it with FTX as much as possible, the Ethereum community held a large role in creating the negative environment that Solana had to rebuild itself in. Now, Solana has emerged from the bear market, still intact. The entire Solana project now understands Ethereum to be no friend of it, and as a result, we find jabs and shade thrown at Ethereum on the mainstage of Solana's annual conference. I'm likely focusing too much on this! But, the collective psychology of crypto tribes is one of the things that fascinates me most about this industry, and while I often find myself playing tribal games just like everyone else, it's always a reminder of how we can all be better, even if our L1s are fundamentally in direct competition with each other. What is Solana excited about?There was plenty of excitement around rebirth and being early, but on a technical level, the one thing that nearly every attendee at Breakpoint seemed most jazzed about was Firedancer. Firedancer is a new Solana client built by the Jump Crypto team.

I went to Solana Breakpoint, put on by the Solana Foundation.It's hard to get a sense of reality these days. As someone with deep ties to the Ethereum community, my only perception of Solana is through Twitter, which is a terrible lens for viewing anything these days, especially in crypto, where tribes continually fight in the area of crypto-twitter to distort perception to their favor. So, my Ethereum circles are left viewing Solana from the outside. If Crypto Twitter can't provide a true reality of Solana, what is there left to do besides go to Breakpoint myself and get the vibes straight from the source? Bankless Nation, here's everything I learned at Solana Breakpoint 👇🏴 @BanklessHQ at @SolanaConf drops 🔜™️ pic.twitter.com/TufouHEtWb— 🩸DavidHoffman.eth🦇🔊 (@TrustlessState) November 1, 2023
Who is the Solana Community? My central quest at this event was understanding the makeup of the Solana community. Who does this ecosystem attract, and why? Solana has attracted a community of engineers that Ethereum was not able to nerd-snipe. These are ex-Apple, ex-Tesla, ex-SpaceX type engineers who are familiar with the relationship between hardware and software. These are highly technical optimizers. Solana provides them the clay to work within a capacity that makes sense to them and in ways that Ethereum did not. In fact, some of the priorities of the Ethereum community likely appear nonsensical and a waste of time to these types of engineers. This feature is likely why Chris Burniske distinguishes the Ethereum community as 'optimists' or 'ideologically motivated' and the Solana community as 'pragmatists.' To me, it makes sense that the 'pragmatists' of crypto would find a cozy home in the space between hardware and software where crypto networks operate, while the ideologically motivated focus more exclusively on the open-source software realm, where values, governance, and identity can be codified. If someone whose perception of the world was dominated through the lens of Crypto Twitter heard that I was going to Solana Breakpoint, they would probably grab their popcorn, thinking, ""Ooo, David's going behind enemy lines!!"" 🍿In reality, the Solana community is just another crypto community. The average person here isn't thinking in tribal terms. Hackers go to both Ethereum and Solana hackathons… and then they go to StarkNet and Near and Chainlink hackathons, too. Some builders choose to stay cause they found a problem they'd like to commit to. I met the team from Marinade, a Solana staking automation platform, and I met Anoushk and Harsh, the dev-duo behind Tinydancer, a Solana light-client. Both teams expressed their appreciation for the content Bankless has been putting out over the years, with the Tinydancer duo saying it had pushed them to get into crypto in the first place. These types of interactions at crypto conferences are always gratifying – and endlessly motivating! Every time I get back from one of these events, I immediately node-sync with Ryan about all of these interactions, because I love sharing the immense amount of positivity and good vibes that exist in the IRL context of Crypto. This is all to say that the IRL Solana community is not that different from the IRL Ethereum community, and it's the more extreme internet leaders of both communities that define the internet-native identities of these ecosystems. What was the Vibe? This was the third-ever Solana Breakpoint, the first coming at the absolute froth of the 2021 market, when SOL was drenched in the ecstasy of its $250+ pico-top, and the 2nd being the week before FTX crashed. 😦It's safe to say that Solana Breakpoint has never been hosted under stable conditions, until now. In my opinion, it's the first time Solana has been able to get a true signal from the community that Breakpoint attracts since, in prior years, it was drowned out by the short-term tourists (and scammers) that Solana attracted during the bull. I wasn't at the first two Breakpoints, so I'm shooting from the hip a bit here. These are takes I've generated after talking to those who did go to these Breakpoints.Congrats to @SolanaConf for being the only conference that caused a pump instead of a dump— 🩸DavidHoffman.eth🦇🔊 (@TrustlessState) November 1, 2023
The vibe of Solana Breakpoint had notes that I was well familiar with from my early days in Ethereum, but with some unique flavorings as well.First, there was a pretty clear sense that the Solana community feels like they're sitting on gold. They know that they've got something that the world will one day want, and that sense of ""pre-rich conviction"" was definitely present. I wouldn't say this vibe was ubiquitous… it was definitely expressed by a minority. The rest of the conference attendees were more indifferent to that aspect, but it was present nonetheless. This vibe naturally brought a nascent sense of optimism and excitement, which I definitely remember feeling during the novelty of my early Ethereum days, especially during my early years at ETH Denver 2018 and 2019. Solana & EthereumThe content featured on the mainstage was all about 👏 scaling 👏 scaling 👏 scaling 👏. If there's one bit of Solana Breakpoint content to consume to catch the vibe, it's the 90min opening presentation by various Solana leaders.

For now, that's everything I learned at Solana Breakpoint!","I just returned from my last conference of 2024. Meeting cool people and encountering new ideas in crypto takes me to some pretty interesting places all over the world, but this last tour was a little different than my typical crypto conference endeavors! For the first time, I went to a non-Ethereum conference 😲 I'm not talking about a generalist conference either, like Permissionless. I went to Solana Breakpoint, put on by the Solana Foundation.It's hard to get a sense of reality these days. As someone with deep ties to the Ethereum community, my only perception of Solana is through Twitter, which is a terrible lens for viewing anything these days, especially in crypto, where tribes continually fight in the area of crypto-twitter to distort perception to their favor. So, my Ethereum circles are left viewing Solana from the outside. If Crypto Twitter can't provide a true reality of Solana, what is there left to do besides go to Breakpoint myself and get the vibes straight from the source? Bankless Nation, here's everything I learned at Solana Breakpoint 👇🏴 @BanklessHQ at @SolanaConf drops 🔜™️ pic.twitter.com/TufouHEtWb— 🩸DavidHoffman.eth🦇🔊 (@TrustlessState) November 1, 2023
Who is the Solana Community? My central quest at this event was understanding the makeup of the Solana community. Who does this ecosystem attract, and why? Solana has attracted a community of engineers that Ethereum was not able to nerd-snipe. These are ex-Apple, ex-Tesla, ex-SpaceX type engineers who are familiar with the relationship between hardware and software. These are highly technical optimizers. Solana provides them the clay to work within a capacity that makes sense to them and in ways that Ethereum did not. In fact, some of the priorities of the Ethereum community likely appear nonsensical and a waste of time to these types of engineers. This feature is likely why Chris Burniske distinguishes the Ethereum community as 'optimists' or 'ideologically motivated' and the Solana community as 'pragmatists.' To me, it makes sense that the 'pragmatists' of crypto would find a cozy home in the space between hardware and software where crypto networks operate, while the ideologically motivated focus more exclusively on the open-source software realm, where values, governance, and identity can be codified. If someone whose perception of the world was dominated through the lens of Crypto Twitter heard that I was going to Solana Breakpoint, they would probably grab their popcorn, thinking, ""Ooo, David's going behind enemy lines!!"" 🍿In reality, the Solana community is just another crypto community. The average person here isn't thinking in tribal terms. Hackers go to both Ethereum and Solana hackathons… and then they go to StarkNet and Near and Chainlink hackathons, too. Some builders choose to stay cause they found a problem they'd like to commit to. I met the team from Marinade, a Solana staking automation platform, and I met Anoushk and Harsh, the dev-duo behind Tinydancer, a Solana light-client. Both teams expressed their appreciation for the content Bankless has been putting out over the years, with the Tinydancer duo saying it had pushed them to get into crypto in the first place. These types of interactions at crypto conferences are always gratifying – and endlessly motivating! Every time I get back from one of these events, I immediately node-sync with Ryan about all of these interactions, because I love sharing the immense amount of positivity and good vibes that exist in the IRL context of Crypto. This is all to say that the IRL Solana community is not that different from the IRL Ethereum community, and it's the more extreme internet leaders of both communities that define the internet-native identities of these ecosystems. What was the Vibe? This was the third-ever Solana Breakpoint, the first coming at the absolute froth of the 2021 market, when SOL was drenched in the ecstasy of its $250+ pico-top, and the 2nd being the week before FTX crashed. 😦It's safe to say that Solana Breakpoint has never been hosted under stable conditions, until now. In my opinion, it's the first time Solana has been able to get a true signal from the community that Breakpoint attracts since, in prior years, it was drowned out by the short-term tourists (and scammers) that Solana attracted during the bull. I wasn't at the first two Breakpoints, so I'm shooting from the hip a bit here. These are takes I've generated after talking to those who did go to these Breakpoints.Congrats to @SolanaConf for being the only conference that caused a pump instead of a dump— 🩸DavidHoffman.eth🦇🔊 (@TrustlessState) November 1, 2023
The vibe of Solana Breakpoint had notes that I was well familiar with from my early days in Ethereum, but with some unique flavorings as well.First, there was a pretty clear sense that the Solana community feels like they're sitting on gold. They know that they've got something that the world will one day want, and that sense of ""pre-rich conviction"" was definitely present. I wouldn't say this vibe was ubiquitous… it was definitely expressed by a minority. The rest of the conference attendees were more indifferent to that aspect, but it was present nonetheless. This vibe naturally brought a nascent sense of optimism and excitement, which I definitely remember feeling during the novelty of my early Ethereum days, especially during my early years at ETH Denver 2018 and 2019. Solana & EthereumThe content featured on the mainstage was all about 👏 scaling 👏 scaling 👏 scaling 👏. If there's one bit of Solana Breakpoint content to consume to catch the vibe, it's the 90min opening presentation by various Solana leaders. (It was hosted on Halloween, hence Anatoly is in a green dragon costume)Anatoly’s “hard problems” during his opening keynote 😂 pic.twitter.com/4h3RjQBdUL— 🩸DavidHoffman.eth🦇🔊 (@TrustlessState) October 31, 2023
It was pretty funny to hear direct jabs at Ethereum during the keynote presentation. Jokes about ""not needing any layers"" and ""Ethereum alignment"" are actually a pretty core part of the Solana DNA at this point. Here, Crypto Twitter has clearly bled into Solana culture, and it's the part that I find least resonant. Solana's identity has largely been shaped by having to survive post-FTX collapse, all while the Ethereum community twists the knife over the rampant extraction culture in the Solana app-layer and the claimed incoherence of the monolithic scaling strategy. The Ethereum community was not nice to Solana in the time in which Solana was down bad the most. And it was at this moment when the Solana community grit its teeth, dug in, chewed glass, and dug itself out of the narrative shithole it found itself in. The narrative around Solana was so bad that it became existential.VCs stopped funding Solana-based projects just because they were building on Solana. $SOL market cap was at $4B, less than half of the 2018-2019 $ETH market cap bottom of $10, during which Ethereum also was faced with existential concerns about its ability to fund itself. I'm pretty sure that this is when Solana leadership took a direct, hands-on approach to fixing the Solana narrative before it became a self-fulfilling prophecy. This was when the Mert reply-guy ratio army started to kick in, and when you would find Anatoly replying to every single tweet about Solana, good or bad. This was when Solana started developing narratives and memes that could revitalize the community around it. And to their credit, it totally worked. The narrative around Solana has found new meaning, new heights, and an insane level of engagement on Twitter. And to our fault, by attempting to ""finish off"" Solana by conflating it with FTX as much as possible, the Ethereum community held a large role in creating the negative environment that Solana had to rebuild itself in. Now, Solana has emerged from the bear market, still intact. The entire Solana project now understands Ethereum to be no friend of it, and as a result, we find jabs and shade thrown at Ethereum on the mainstage of Solana's annual conference. I'm likely focusing too much on this! But, the collective psychology of crypto tribes is one of the things that fascinates me most about this industry, and while I often find myself playing tribal games just like everyone else, it's always a reminder of how we can all be better, even if our L1s are fundamentally in direct competition with each other. What is Solana excited about?There was plenty of excitement around rebirth and being early, but on a technical level, the one thing that nearly every attendee at Breakpoint seemed most jazzed about was Firedancer. Firedancer is a new Solana client built by the Jump Crypto team. The original Solana client, built by the Solana Foundation, is overloaded with tech debt and isn't optimized. The Firedancer client is promised to bring massive improvements to Solana network performance.The Firedancer client can be considered as a big network upgrade to Solana, a Solana 2.0 if you will. It's akin to the Ethereum excitement around something like EIP1559 or the Merge, except it's focused on performance. The Firedancer testnet was announced at Breakpoint, much to the excitement of the entire community. Exploring what this all means for Solana and validator economics is something a bit outside of my knowledge and is perhaps something we will explore on Bankless in the future. 👀 Firedancer also unlocks a critical property of Solana, which is becoming a multi-client network. Single-client networks are fragile and prone to downtime. With Firedancer, Solana gets a second client, meaningfully increasing its robustness.Granted, having a network that is one part Firedancer and one part the older Solana client from the Foundation is not going to work since the whole network will be bottlenecked by the older client, but in my conversations with Austin, he said the suggested architecture is that Firedancer client operators run the older Solana client as a fallback, with Firedancer as the primary. Apparently, this gets you the best of both worlds, which is neat. Another thing that caught my eye is Solana's Token22 software package. Token22 is a token software enhancement package that brings a ton of additional functionality to Solana tokens, including custom permissions and confidential transactions, aka privacy. For further rabbit holes on what is exciting the Solana community, listen to the latter half of my conversation with Austin and Anatoly at Breakpoint! So, am I bullish Solana? Solana has certainly captured more of my attention lately. So, what's the deal? Is Bankless finally bullish Solana? Or is David's attention being truly captured by the Solana community engagement-attacking him inside of the arena of Twitter narrative warfare campaigns? Is it something else? To be honest, I don't have an answer here. Chris Burniske recently attempted to try and shoehorn me into either bullish or bearish SOL on Twitter, which I felt frustrated by. How I intend to engage with the Solana community, I will let the future decide. I do know that I vibe with the Ethereum community at a very deep level, and that part of that Ethereum community spirit still feels meaningfully absent in the Solana community.It was disheartening to see a fully packed room during a panel conversation on Solana validator economics, and then when the next panel came on to discuss the future of Solana community governance, the completely full room emptied out.

While the sudden dismissal and rehiring of Sam Altman as CEO made for an HBO-worthy drama, it's essential to realize why there were so many eyes on this company to begin with. The tech is impressive. Earlier this year, I walked you through the basics of ChatGPT plugins. Remember: ChatGPT is an AI chatbot service, and plugins are external tools built on top of ChatGPT to enhance its capabilities. Some crypto-themed ones, like CheckTheChain and DefiLlama, have proven helpful for onchain analysts. Yet, while plugins remain some of the most powerful things about ChatGPT, it's worth noting that the platform has rolled out a series of new features since my previous post, and all are compelling in their own ways. Some of ChatGPT's coolest features are only available to subscribers of its Plus service, which has unfortunately briefly paused new sign-ups due to significant demand. What you use all of these new features for depends on your needs or imagination, but to help you get started, I'll walk through the basics of how crypto adventurers like ourselves can start approaching these ChatGPT additions. 👇👇 1) Custom instructions Custom instructions, accessible from your account tab, allows you to tailor how ChatGPT responds to your text prompts per your specific preferences or requirements. For example, let's say you're a smart contract developer using ChatGPT as a de facto coding assistant. In its vanilla state, the chatbot tends to unnecessarily over-explain things, so to avoid having to constantly deal with this, you could provide a custom instruction to ""just give me code without any explanation,"" as seen in the screenshot above. You don't have to be a dev to get this utility. I've found that generic ChatGPT can be very wordy and use too much prose in its answers. One custom instruction I use when outlining and editing content with the platform is ""avoid flowery language,"" which, in my opinion, helps considerably. Experiment and see what works for you!","It's been a controversial month for ChatGPT creator OpenAI.

Experiment and see what works for you!2) ChatGPT visionOpenAI recently launched new capabilities for ChatGPT, including the ability to see and analyze pictures. Now, you can ask the AI any question you want about the picture on your mind!This can be useful across many different contexts, one of which is extracting data from an image. For example, have you ever found a bespoke crypto infographic on social media that you wanted to write about but had trouble reading its fine print or didn't want to manually transcribe its info to your draft? Now you can ask ChatGPT to pull the info for you, like so: After I punched in the request seen in the image above, ChatGPT returned the answer back to me in ~1 second.3) Advanced Data AnalysisFormerly known as the ""Code Interpreter,"" the Advanced Data Analysis tool is a special version of ChatGPT that has the ability to use the Python programming language baked right in. As such, the resource is optimized compared to its regular counterpart when it comes to analyzing data, interpreting code, and calculating math problems. If you need assistance in any of these areas, you've now got your own specialized AI assistant that can help you. For example, I'm not a programmer, so I recently used Advanced Data Analysis to analyze the Nouns DAO codebase. But you can also do all kinds of other things, like extracting and visualizing info from a PDF file or running simulations based on provided crypto data. 4) DALL·E 3DALL·E 3 is a new, incredibly performant text-to-image AI model available within ChatGPT.If you're a community manager or content creator in crypto, DALL·E 3 is a must-try because it makes it possible to pump out detailed, high-quality graphics in just a matter of seconds. Compared to other similar models like Midjourney and Stable Diffusion, DALL·E 3 particularly shines when it comes to handling intricate prompts. Note that the model will pump out four image outputs per prompt request, so you'll have multiple options to choose from or remix further from there. In my experience, there's always at least one output from a batch that meets the ""above average"" bar. 5) GPTsThe latest innovation in ChatGPT's evolution is this month's introduction of GPTs, which are customizable AI models that users can tailor for specific tasks. The big idea? Create an AI agent and then openly share it with others!Whether for learning, work, or play, GPTs take personalized instructions via basic no-code prompting and can then perform a range of functions, from creative design to web searches. As such, this rollout represents a significant step towards AI minds capable of performing real-world tasks autonomously.Action steps🤖 Explore ChatGPT: Consider a Plus account to try all the new features (Plus sign-ups currently paused)🦾 Read the original plugins primer: Explore Crypto with ChatGPT✍️ Up your prompting game: Try this basic 6-step prompt formula",https://www.bankless.com/openai-crypto-journey,2023-11-27T00:00:00.000Z,https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/2023/11/lu.ma._an_intelligent_robot_on_the_stock_market_trading_floor_fe2c0c08-c23a-4ce0-b77e-eba7b0e8a4a4.png,William M.

As a result, Solana will be fighting an uphill battle for protocols, liquidity, and users.Thanks to its low-fee environment, global state machine, and ability to provide consensus at the speed of light, Solana promises to unlock a new frontier of applications not possible on Ethereum; hopefully, they will come soon!While the hype cycle of airdrops and their resulting wealth effect will likely be enough to attract new ecosystem participants to Solana and bolster key stats, to realize success from airdrops, Solana must nurture its own DeFi ecosystem and have a wide array of protocols ready to airdrop tokens.Perhaps airdrops will be the fuel to incept another wave of Solana protocols; however, tragically, the current depth of tokenless protocols on the network of size is less than impressive, greatly diminishing the benefit that airdrops could have on the Solana ecosystem.",https://www.bankless.com/solana-airdrop-season,2023-11-29T00:00:00.000Z,https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/2023/11/lu.ma._gift-wrapped_packages_raining_down_from_stormy_sky_seafo_32dc8080-9713-450a-933b-7f74c111a82b.png,Jack Inabinet,Bankless,blog,Unknown Error,

Solana is massively hyped at the moment. That's what happens when a coin goes up 900% in a year. It's attracted the capital and attention of VCs anew as well as emboldened the community who believed in it before it was cool again. To be sure, the launch of Jito just sparked a version of Ethereum's 2020 DeFi summer on Solana, and now it's clear that the network's app layer has risen from the ashes of the 2022-23 bear market . With Solana's SOL having just entered the top 5 crypto assets accordingly, all eyes are on Solana to see if it can do what all its biggest supporters think it can do: be the most likely place to host breakout consumer crypto applications in this incoming bull market. Suppose Solana is going to fulfill its potential here. In that case, it will need to attract more novel founders who build more novel applications that are not just shinier versions of the same thing that Ethereum already has. Solana will need to produce new types of apps that crypto has not yet seen before, uniquely enabled by the properties the network offers . DePIN seems to be the early standout contender category here. However, I think the jury is still out as to whether there is any substance here. We'll see, though, and the sector's worth tracking closely in the meantime either way. Meanwhile, plenty of tokenless Solana protocols are still left to airdrop their tokens in 2024, which means, at the very least, hype and attention will remain on Solana until they do. Whether Solana can retain its spotlight after its version of DeFi Summer is over remains to be seen. Internally, the attention in Solana has turned towards its economics. With some of Solana's hardest problems in the rearview mirror, it's now time to turn to the next lowest-hanging fruit in the project, which is its native fee markets and overall economic structure. Can Solana fix its economics? Only time will tell, but its community likes its chances more than ever .","Bankless Nation, welcome to the 2024 edition of Crypto™!2023 started with some of the most bearish sentiments our space had ever experienced, and it concluded with one of the most bullish setups we've ever seen.As we enter this 2024 bull market with a fresh second wind, it's time to spotlight some key investment themes poised to shape the new year. Stay ahead of the curve by understanding these six narrative metas set to dominate in the months ahead! 👇1️⃣ Restaking and Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs) The restaking meta is already getting loud, and EigenLayer hasn't even hit mainnet yet. With over $1B deposited into the EigenLayer contracts today, the jostling to become a significant player in the EigenLayer ecosystem has already produced fierce competition. As such, the Liquid Staking Token (LST) wars are about to be restarted again, but this time, it'll be the LRT wars. Liquid Restaking Tokens will have all the yields of native ETH staking plus the extra yields produced by adding restaking networks. Why would someone settle for 5% LST yields when they can get more with LRT yields?What are LRTs, you ask? They're just like LSTs but have the yields produced from EigenLayer baked inside the token. EigenLayer enables AVS (Actively Validated Services, i.e. EigenLayer networks), which all produce some yield or fees for people who restake their ETH to them. People who restake will likely restake to a plurality of AVS to maximize their staked ETH's productivity and increase their yields. That said, producing a service that does this safely and efficiently will be valuable for the less technical users like me who know that others can do it better. And this is where LRTs come in. LRTs aggregate user deposits, restake them across EigenLayer networks, capture all the yield, and pass it along to the depositors. Pretty compelling! Yet beyond the fundamental utility here, one of the reasons why I think 2024 is going to start with an LRT boom is because the latest airdrop wave meta has already kicked in. Amid this massive flurry of interest and activity, LRT projects are ""double-whammy,"" two-for-one airdrop hunting opportunities. For example, Swell is currently offering their ""Pearls,"" which I assume are placeholder points for the eventual Swell token, on top of EigenLayer points, which I presume are placeholders, too. Ready. Set. Restake! 🟢

swETH is now live on @Eigenlayer with limited availability! 🔥

Restake for 30 Pearls + EigenLayer pointshttps://t.co/lpDNHe8lDz pic.twitter.com/oGVGRllUkH— Swell (@swellnetworkio) December 18, 2023
Frankly, I think EigenLayer is setting up to be one of the largest airdrops of all time, and the competition to become the dominant LRT token in Ethereum will be as hot as the competition to become the dominant LST token was. Admittedly, I am not familiar with all the LRT strategies from all the current LRT teams. Here, I will leave you to do your own due diligence. However, there are two projects that I'm paying attention to because I am close with the teams from either investing as an angel, or investing through Bankless Ventures, which are Puffer and Swell as mentioned earlier.Notably, Puffer has a unique advantage from their work with SGX—extra slashing protection—as an extra layer of defense against capital loss. This mechanism, along with Puffer's collaboration with Justin Drake on Smoothing Commitments and with Andrew Miller from Flashbots on Remote Attestations, positions the project to unlock efficiencies and opportunities that other LRTs may have to play catch up with. And as for Swell, it was an LST project that pivoted into Liquid Restaking when they saw the writing on the wall. With ETH TVL in its system when EigenLayer opened up its doors for deposits, Swell was already near the front of the competition. Now, Swell is #1 out of the LRT projects with deposits in EigenLayer and is #2 in LST deposits behind Lido. Yet there are a handful of projects worth keeping an eye on in this scene right now, including: Rio Network EtherFiRenzo Protocol Kelp DAO Don't get caught dozing here then, track the action going forward with this great EigenLayer Dune dashboard that surveys its LRT battlefield at any given time.Disclaimer: Ryan and I are advisers to EigenLayer and angel investors in Swell Network. Bankless Ventures is an investor in Puffer. 2️⃣ SolanaIs the meta now ""Bitcoin, Ethereum… and Solana?"" Solana is massively hyped at the moment. That's what happens when a coin goes up 900% in a year. It's attracted the capital and attention of VCs anew as well as emboldened the community who believed in it before it was cool again. To be sure, the launch of Jito just sparked a version of Ethereum's 2020 DeFi summer on Solana, and now it's clear that the network's app layer has risen from the ashes of the 2022-23 bear market. With Solana's SOL having just entered the top 5 crypto assets accordingly, all eyes are on Solana to see if it can do what all its biggest supporters think it can do: be the most likely place to host breakout consumer crypto applications in this incoming bull market. Suppose Solana is going to fulfill its potential here. In that case, it will need to attract more novel founders who build more novel applications that are not just shinier versions of the same thing that Ethereum already has. Solana will need to produce new types of apps that crypto has not yet seen before, uniquely enabled by the properties the network offers. DePIN seems to be the early standout contender category here. However, I think the jury is still out as to whether there is any substance here. We'll see, though, and the sector's worth tracking closely in the meantime either way.Meanwhile, plenty of tokenless Solana protocols are still left to airdrop their tokens in 2024, which means, at the very least, hype and attention will remain on Solana until they do. Whether Solana can retain its spotlight after its version of DeFi Summer is over remains to be seen. Internally, the attention in Solana has turned towards its economics. With some of Solana's hardest problems in the rearview mirror, it's now time to turn to the next lowest-hanging fruit in the project, which is its native fee markets and overall economic structure. Can Solana fix its economics? Only time will tell, but its community likes its chances more than ever. 3️⃣ GamingGaming seems to be the surest category for a breakout crypto application in the near future. Mainly because we know that many highly-anticipated games are in development right now, and some of them will be coming to market in 2024.If the games are fun, gamers will play them. If game developers know what they're doing, they will tastefully introduce crypto elements as needed and not have them as overwhelming elements of the game. Gaming content is a massive industry in itself, and the distribution that crypto will be able to access via the gaming sector is massive. The best thing about the contemporary crypto gaming sector is how it is being shifted away from an explicit focus on crypto-native players. Many of these new games are being built for people who are crypto-agnostic. This shift puts our space in striking distance of one of the largest demographics on the planet, as there are currently around 3.2 BILLION gamers globally. If we can build a game that attracts the crypto-agnostic, it will be among the first breakout examples of crypto offering something for those who don't care about crypto. In the meantime, look at gaming ecosystems like Immutable and its IMX token as a proxy for excitement here. Immutable, which is working on a gaming-specific zkEVM chain built on Polygon, currently has a higher valuation than Arbitrum!4️⃣ DA WarsThe Data Availability wars have also begun, and the starting pistol was the one-two punch of the TIA airdrop at a $2B valuation, followed by an up-only chart straight to $14B FDV.Why is everyone obsessing over Data Availability now, then? Stay tuned for an upcoming Bankless podcast episode with Jon Charbannou and Neel Somani where we dive deep into the question: ""Is DA a good business model?"" You won't want to miss it!That said, it's fair to assume that DA is like the bandwidth stratum of Web3, and cheap DA layers will take crypto from slow and expensive to fast, cheap, and plentiful without sacrificing decentralization along the way. Indeed, DA is the main bottleneck preventing chains from taking off the brakes around their resource costs and throughput levels. As such, whatever DA chains can rise to meet these needs can see long-term sustainable value flows in the cryptoeconomy.My eyes are on the upcoming launch of EigenDA, EigenLayer's first AVS to come online, which will be the first additional source of yield going into the LRT tokens I mentioned earlier.EigenDA is constructed differently from Celestia and has some unique properties as a network. To learn more about that, listen to my recent episode with Sreeram and Teddy from EigenLayer. Since EigenDA is secured by staked ETH and not an alternative L1, this makes the DA properties of EigenDA more proximate to Ethereum, reducing some security assumptions and perhaps making it an easier choice for rollups who still need more DA than what the Ethereum L1 can offer.Celestia and EigenDA are the two leading contenders here right now, but others are also entering the DA wars. For example, NEAR has added DA capabilities to its chain, which also has some unique properties due to the sharding research that NEAR has done over the last few years. I am sure there are more that I have yet to hear of, or that are in stealth, which will come to market in 2024 since the bounty for the DA race is now so large.5️⃣ Parallelized EVMsSolana has induced an urgency in building out optimized VMs for Web3. I asked Solana founder Anatoly Yakovenko on a recent episode, ""What is the most critical component of Solana,"" to which he replied: ""The parallelization of the SVM."" This unique property that Solana brought to market is the ability for multiple transactions to be processed at once, so long as the transactions aren't touching the same state as each other. This is a huge strength of the SVM and a big weakness of the EVM. And now the parallel VM wars are being fought both on Ethereum L2s and on new L1s. For instance, the Eclipse project is taking the SVM and building a rollup that settles on Ethereum (using Celestia for DA), and it's not the only one doing this. Monad is another project that's been working on parallelizing the EVM for a while now. Rebuilding the EVM to go from single-threaded to multi-threaded is no easy task, but the rewards for successful execution here are large. Imagine Solana's scale, speed, and inexpensiveness but with Ethereum's ecosystem. Monad is going for bytecode equivalence of the EVM, meaning that any bit of code that's ever been written inside of the EVM environment can immediately port over to Monad without cost. The ""Solana's speed but Ethereum's distribution"" strategy is being identified by more than just Monad and Eclipse. This strategy has also been embraced by Sei, as demonstrated in their recent pivot announcement to becoming a parallelized EVM chain. Take note, as I started writing this article in December, and since then SEI's price has exploded as people have piled onto this narrative faster than I saw coming. Since Monad isn't live, SEI has been the only way to gain readily exposure to the parallelized EVM narrative, and thus its token has appreciated accordingly. While Monad seems intent on remaining as an independent L1, I predict that the Monad EVM is going to become a target for EVM alternatives on Ethereum L2s. If Monad open-sources its EVM, it's going to be a very hot piece of software for Web3. It may also be a viable strategy for Monad to do both an ETH L2 in parallel to its independent L1 to make sure it's filling the competitive landscape as much as possible. I had a conversation with Ansgar last November, in which he expressed interest in L2s finding a new VM spec to design around, one that is far more optimized for execution than simply reproducing the L1 EVM as an L2. The thought process is if we can find a better virtual machine for L2s that is more execution optimized, we can rally L2s to use that as the standard rather than the traditional (and slow) EVM. This shift would take coordination, but it would vastly improve the Ethereum L2 space. 6️⃣ AirdropsMy very safe prediction for 2024 is that $2B will be airdropped into users' hands. EigenLayer might even achieve that just by itself. Biggest Aidrops of all Time: 

1. $ARB - $1.5b dropped to users, at $15b FDV
2. $ENS - $1b dropped, at $40b FDV 
3. $dYdX - $900m, at $11b FDV

Airdrops weren't new in 2021, but the retroactive Uniswap airdrop did trigger a new paradigm of what airdrops meant and how apps can leverage them. Fast forward to today, and some of the biggest projects in the space have been fine-tuning their token launch plans for years. Now, then, it's time for action. For example, StarkNet and LayerZero both recently confirmed their upcoming token launches, and I expect both of these to happen in Q1 2024. These airdrops will force the hand of others to hasten their tokens, too. Once the full momentum of a new airdrop season begins, it will be hard to stop. After all the majors drop their tokens and place billions into users' hands, you'll have the follow-ons quickly develop their ""app"" and ship their ""tokens"" to catch the wave.Once this happens, you'll know that we're approaching peak levels of froth and it's time to begin selling, not buying. Be careful out there. The trap of airdrop farming will likely pull much of your capital in to maximize gains, but this will occur at a time in which it is rational to be pulling your capital out. Alameda, for example, began their operations with 0-risk bitcoin arbitrages across exchanges, and as the bull market progressed, ended up fully levered in illiquid shitcoins. You want to do the opposite. You want to start fully levered in illiquid shitcoins, and then sell into dollars, BTC, ETH, and other risk-off positions as the bull market progresses. If you don't know where to start optimizing your 2024 airdrop gains, use the Bankless Airdrop Hunter! Hunters > Farmers. Airdrops want real users, and the Bankless Airdrop Hunter helps you both learn how to use crypto (safely!) while optimizing your chances of getting an airdrop.

The synthetic examples above have problems of capital inefficiency, which can be mitigated in part by identity systems and new mechanism designs. ETH is also highly volatile. While this is expected in the early days of an emerging commodity money, it’s a challenge for the systems built on top of it. Systems like Maker help to stabilize ETH, and I expect to see the DAI form of ETH (DAI is just stabilized ETH afterall) increase in use as a reserve asset. Still, problems aside, if you squint you can see it. ETH as a reserve asset for ICO fundraising should have been an early clue. ETH’s use today in the DeFi protocols now makes it obvious: ETH is becoming a reserve asset before our eyes. The path to money Vitalik finished his statement above with this one: So the road to the usefulness of ETH as a [money] is different than the road taken by the Bitcoin community, but it’s still...” He was cut-off, but I think he was about to end with “still valid”. This sounds a lot like the Tale of Two Money Systems from last week. And I think it’s true. The path for ETH as a reserve asset for the world goes something like this: Stage 1: ETH becomes reserve asset for Ethereum economy Stage 2: ETH becomes reserve asset for crypto economy Stage 3: ETH becomes reserve asset for world economy We’re in stage 1-2 right now. We’ll know we’re at three when the large financial institutions and central banks start buying up ETH and ETH bonds for their balance sheets. And it’s very possible ETH never gets to Stage 3. But there’s a chance it does. And if it ever does, it’ll be because of it’s first strength as a reserve asset for a flourishinng Ethereum economy. ETH as a Stage 1 reserve asset may measure in the trillions. ETH as a Stage 3 reserve asset may measure in the tens of trillions. That’s the bet. Actions Consider: how will ETH as a reserve asset play out? Continue leveling up. $12 per month. 20% off if you subscribe before November 1. Get 20% off forever","Dear Crypto Natives,Happy Thursday. On Thursday’s we zoom out. We think. We calibrate.Earlier this month I introduced the crypto money portfolio: money bets, bank bets, and stablecoins. I recommended the money bets as your biggest holding—the big thing you need to get right for everything to fall into place.So today we’re spending more time on money layer of the skill cube. Last week we talked about the two paths to money for ETH & BTC. Now it’s time to zoom in on each. We’ll do ETH first, since less is written here, and since it’s currently the more contrarian of the two money bets. But I’ll be getting to BTC a bit later.Tomorrow I’ll send you an action summary as you head into the weekend.- RSA

Quick note: Inner Circle had an incredible start—caliber of folks is off the charts—will update you tomorrow—I think you’ll want access to this resourceTHURSDAY THOUGHTSome background: i’ve written previously about ETH as a triple-point asset—a reserve currency for a non-sovereign economic network. Read my thread first to get up to speed.ETH the reserve assetA reserve asset is an asset held by banks. It backs the value of other assets and balances interbank transactions. Reserve assets are readily transferable and highly liquid. Sovereign-bonds, currencies, and gold are the reserve assets of central banks.ETH is also a reserve asset.Not yet for central banks, but for money protocols.And the reserve asset quality of ETH provides utility to the Ethereum economy.Here’s how Vitalik Buterin put it last week:ETH has a lot of intrinsic utility as a reserve asset for the Ethereum ecosystem. It’s the only fully trustless asset that can be used as collateral for a lot of decentralized finance applications. It’s the natural asset to use for things like security deposits. It’s the most convenient asset to use for payments between Ethereum applications.ETH as collateral backing. ETH for security deposits. ETH to balance transactions.ETH providing intrinsic utility to the Ethereum economy not just for fuel or for network security, but through its value as a reserve asset.And that makes sense.As crazy as it sounds, reserve assets are valuable because they’re valuable. And the higher their liquidity and aggregate value the better they can serve as reserve assets.(This is a reflexive (self-reinforcing) property by the way. A higher value ETH makes it a better reserve asset, leading to a higher value ETH, making it a better reserve asset and so on.)For ETH value is utility.That means ETH price is economic bandwidth.ETH price is economic bandwidthThink about DAI.DAI is a synthetic asset pegged to a dollar and backed by ETH as a reserve asset—a debt note for ETH issued by the Maker money protocol. It works much the way banks used to issue bank notes backed by gold or the way dollars used to be redeemable for bullion.Today DAI uses $316m of ETH to mint $86m of DAI.That means 1.3% of all ETH supply is backing DAI as a reserve asset.But let’s say the network value of ETH was 50x smaller than it is today. So $446m instead of $22b. 2016 levels. To get $86m DAI at the same collateral ratio it would take 70% of all ETH supply. DAI couldn’t feasibly grow past $100m. A boutique money—nothing world changing.But what if the network value of ETH were 50x larger that it is today? That’s $1.1 trillion in network value with an ETH price above $10k. In that case using 30% of ETH supply at similar ratios would put DAI over $100b—the size of an entry-level global currency.See what I mean?The potential size of DAI is capped by the economic bandwidth of ETH.If the price of ETH increases, the economic bandwidth available to money protocols also increases. Like dial-up internet vs fiber—only for money.Value is utility.ETH is the only optionThat’s silly you say. Why not use other tokenized sources of value as collateral for something like DAI? Tokenized USD, real-estate, sovereign bonds, even BTC seems like a good candidate.Pay close attention to what Vitalik said above, ETH is “the only fully trustless asset that can be used as collateral”. He’s right. ETH is the only reserve asset in Ethereum that doesn’t have a trusted dependency of some kind. It’s the only reserve asset that settles fully onchain—a digital bearer instrument. 

Run through the list of alternative reserves:USDC: legal system settlement / trust CoinbaseReal-Estate: legal system settlement / physical confiscation / trust the issuerSovereign bonds: legal system settlement / trust the issuerwBTC: onchain settlement / trust BitGotBTC: onchain settlement / trust Oracle / still requires ETH collateralNow ETH:ETH: onchain settlement / trustlessSee the difference?Yes, there’s going to be demand for less trustless assets, no question. But if you want a purely trustless reserve asset on Ethereum—something closer to native Bitcoin and farther from a tokenized security—then ETH is irreplaceable.It’s your only option. And it’s your best option.Trustless reserve assets at the baseMaybe you’re skeptical that the average joe would ever prefer trustless assets if it means sacrificing some convenience. That’s fine. So am I.But here’s something to keep in mind: a trustless asset can become trusted but the reverse is not true. You can take ETH and make it trusted by putting it in Coinbase and turning into a Coinbase-IOU, but you can’t make a Coinbase-IOU as trustless as pure ETH.That’s why I think it’s likely that trustless and neutral assets will form the base of this parallel money system on which all the other trusted assets are built. The neutrality of TCP/IP is why the internet was adopted so broadly. It wouldn’t have happend if it was owned by Microsoft.Why should the internet of value be any different?The internet of valueBack to DAI. It’s not the only use for ETH as a reserve asset. Almost all of the money protocols use ETH as a reserve in some way. Uniswap uses it as a deeply liquid trading pair. Compound uses it as a dependable collateral source.And one of the most exciting uses of ETH’s economic bandwidth is in the world of trustless synthetics—coming fast and furious right now. I wrote a tweetstorm about this last week after trying out the UMA protocol:A trustless reserve asset coupled with a money protocol like UMA is powerful stuff. It gives anyone in the world the ability to issue, trade, lend, borrow any asset—buy TELSA exposure from an internet cafe in a small city in Central America. Or short real-estate in San Fransisco.Global, permissionless, open.No borders.Does that seem bizarre?Remember when the idea of broadcasting your own tv channel from anywhere in the world was bizarre?The internet of value.A store-of-value money legoMy friend David Hoffman coined the phrase money legos to describe the composability of money protocols on ETH. You snap money functions together with code to create money nouns that do the money verbs. Like lego.And the most important money lego is the one that sits at the bottom of all this. The programmable store-of-value lego that gets snapped together with others to create trustless stablecoins, exchanges, money markets, and synthetic assets.Without a crypto native store-of-value these money protocols wouldn’t be trustless at all. They’d have to import sources of value from legacy finance.ETH—the reserve asset of the Ethereum Economy.ETH—the store-of-value money lego.A ways to go…I’d be remiss to point out that there’s still a ways to go for ETH as a reserve asset.

And if it ever does, it’ll be because of it’s first strength as a reserve asset for a flourishinng Ethereum economy.ETH as a Stage 1 reserve asset may measure in the trillions.ETH as a Stage 3 reserve asset may measure in the tens of trillions.That’s the bet.ActionsConsider: how will ETH as a reserve asset play out?Continue leveling up. $12 per month. 20% off if you subscribe before November 1.Get 20% off foreverFilling out the skill cubeBy considering ETH’s path to reserve asset status you’re leveling up on the money layer of the skill cube.

https://balancer.finance/Participants:Fernando Martinelli, co-founder & CEO at Balancer LabsFollowTheChain, crypto researcher
Moderator:Alright everyone, let’s do this. Please give a warm welcome to Fernando, co-founder & CEO @ Balancer Labs!As a reminder for everyone participating—please keep the discussion respectful at all times.Fernando—could you start off by giving us a brief bio on your background as well as how you got started in crypto? And then a short overview of Balancer and a brief update on your progress to date? We’ll then be off to the races with questions.Fernando:Hello everyone and thanks for the invite!I'm Fernando, co-founder & CEO @ Balancer Labs, the company developing Balancer Protocol. I'm a Brazilian control & automation engineer with a masters in robotics and image processing. I have already founded 4 companies prior to BLabs, did an MBA at the Sorbonne University and worked as a strategy consultant for Bain & Co in Germany.Thanks to FollowTheChain I have been introduced to crypto in early 2013. FollowTheChain is a long-time friend, crypto research partner and close collaborator to BLabs. He is joining me today to help answer any questions you have.We’ve been following Ethereum since its inception. In early 2016 we got in touch with the Maker team and met them all in person in their first gathering in Miami. We collaborated with research and simulations on automatically updating system parameters to ensure DAI’s peg is maintained. Being very active members of the Maker community in its early days is how we got to know Nikolai Mushegian better. Earlier this year he became Balancer’s seed investor, co-founder and chief architect.Balancer came to life early last year as a project within BlockScience. Over time we realized there was potential for it to become an important primitive not only for DeFi/Ethereum but also for other chains that hold tokenized assets. We then spun it off from BlockScience and created Balancer Labs. We got out of stealth mode about 10 days ago.So, what is Balancer?It's a liquidity provider and portfolio management tool. Balancer provides a smart contract factory that enables the permissionless creation of new Balancer pools.A Balancer pool is a smart contract that contains 2 or more different types of tokens. It allows anyone to trade any pair of tokens contained in the pool. This way, the pool achieves two main goals at once:It automatically rebalances the portfolio of tokens it holds (e.g if 80% of the value of the pool is in MKR and 20% is in DAI, regardless of the price of MKR relative to DAI, you’ll always have these same proportions of value inside the pool).It generates revenue from trading fees to liquidity providers of the pool.Balancer protocol supports two types of balancer pools, private and shared:*Private pools* are fully flexible. They allow their creator to change any parameters at any time. For instance, a private pool could start with 15% MKR, 15% WETH and 70% DAI, with a 0.1% trading fee. The owner can at any time add a new token type, change the weights of existing tokens or even change the trading fee. However, only the creator of the pool can contribute liquidity to it.*Shared pools* must have all their parameters defined upon creation and are fixed forever. A shared pool creator does not have ANY special rights over the pool they created. Anyone can contribute liquidity to shared pools and get pool shares in return. The amount of shares a liquidity provider gets is the same whether they are early liquidity providers or late (no bonding curve embedded)Anonymous:Hi Fernando! What fee levels do you think will be most popular?(Order of magnitude)Fernando:Hi, we believe that they will gravitate around a little bit less than the average across other exchanges. But it really depends on the tokens in the pool.Fernando:In the end, since the trading fees are customizable, we believe the market will find a sweet spot on its own.Anonymous:Ah, interesting. So you don't anticipate people setting, like, 10% fees, to reduce the impermanent loss from rebalancing?Fernando:We'll be totally permissionless, I'm sure someone will try that out. Let's see how these pools behave in practice.Anonymous:Hi Fernando! Could you compare and contrast Balancer to protocols many of us are familiar with such as 1) Uniswap and 2) Set protocol?Fernando:Hey, sure. Let me expand on itBalancer was conceptualized and designed well before Uniswap was made public, Balancer can be seen as a more flexible/customizable and generalized protocol for liquidity providers. While from our PoV Uniswap was created with a focus on being an exchange (see URL .exchange), Balancer has been designed from the ground up to be a great tool to attract liquidity, allowing for example any custom portfolio to instantly become a Balancer pool an earn trading fees. This significantly opens up the design space for portfolio management and index funds.Set Protocol does a great job at automating rebalancing functionality and even more complex portfolio management strategies like moving average crossovers. The big difference to Balancer, however, is that Set Protocol consumes liquidity in the occasional events when a rebalance is triggered.Balancer protocol OTOH *provides* liquidity. It continuously rebalances its pools in that it lets traders buy tokens when a pool needs to sell them to rebalance and vice-versa. The two main advantages of that strategy are:we do not have sporadic trading events that may be subject to slippage and front-running (imagine traders knowing that a big set is about to auction off millions of DAI)we actually make money from traders that use Balancer pools to trade, increasing the chances of making a pool profitable.Set protocol has a great deal of flexibility in different trading strategies it support while Balancer supports only continuous rebalancing by default. Nonetheless one can build and emulate all sorts of strategies by using smart contracts that own private pools.Anonymous:Hi Fernando! How do you think about composability for Balancer? Beyond the smart order routing engine and the pooling features, can devs build on / plug into balancer to provide other services such as staking management, tax reporting/optimization, etc..?Fernando:Great question, it actually already contains some answers that we believe are viable =) Let me expand on some other ideas we have:The owner of a private pool is an ethereum address. Such address could be a smart contract embedding any rules desired: a company multisig; the treasury of MolochDAO; the emulation of a shared Balancer pool (forwarding liquidity to the underlying private pool) with customized governance; a proxy for atomizing arbitrage actions (making the most of composability opportunities); a contract for automating portfolio strategy updates (allowing anyone to poke it, triggering a change of the private pool parameters according to pre-specified rules); and so on... it’s a huge design space for others to build on top of.Anonymous:How do you avoid sandwich attacks on the price oracle?Fernando:Great question. We expect others to come up with solutions to that. For example one thing that comes to my mind is using an average over a few blocks in the past. So the attacker would have to spend a lot of money gaming the prices in many different blocks in the past.Anonymous:Also, are you taking fees to support your development or extracting rent in the protocol in any way?Fernando:Yes. Balancer introduces an exit fee that is also customizable by the pool creator. This fee goes almost fully back to the remaining liquidity providers (so can be seen as a tax paid by short-term oriented LPs to long term oriented LPs). A small part of that fee will go to BLabs for the development/support of Balancer Protocol. We imagine a common exit fee will be around 0.1% (which does not change much of the profit/loss an LP has after staying in the pool for a few months). From that 0.1% we plan on getting 10%, so in the end the protocol will have a 0.01% fee over the liquidity that exits pools.Fernando:We do NOT take any cut on trading fees thoughWe believe that an exit fee has the advantage of providing an incentive alignment for Balancer to attract long term oriented liquidity providers. A 0.1% exit fee on the principal should not bother them at all if they stay long enough in the pool.Anonymous:Could you please help me understand what's considered an exit?Fernando:An exit is when the liquidity provider withdraws liquidity from a Balancer poolAnonymous:So if I'm a liquidity provider and have BAT, REP, and OMG in Pool A and then trade my REP for BAT, do I always exit Pool A?Fernando:Providing liquidity is totally separate from trading. You can only trade tokens that are not in the pool already. When you trade you only pay trading fees.Anonymous:> Nonetheless one can build and emulate all sorts of strategies by using smart contracts that own private pools.Is Balancer building the tools for these types of strategies?Fernando:Our total focus is to first build Balancer protocol as the best primitive possible: well tested/audited, clear documentation, low surface of attack etc. However, if we feel that the community is taking to long to come up with these tools on top of Balancer we do envisage taking on that role with specific dedicated teams within Balancer Labs.Anonymous:Got it. Thanks.FollowTheChain:Re Composability, here's another thought.Pools accept any ERC20, so the community will be able to innovate on top: creating whatever building blocks they want and throwing them into Balancer pools, in a permissionless way.An example to illustrate:In a pool consisting of lent stablecoin receipts, depositing cDAI instead of DAI would allow liquidity providers to profit from fees while also accruing interest from lent DAI. This however would cause some impermanent loss due to different rate of interests each stablecoin has.But one could create a “synthetic lent DAI” (SLDAI): user sends DAI to wrapper contract, which forwards it to Compound and stores cDAI; each SLDAI is always worth 1 DAI, and increased value from cDAI is forwarded to another address as newly minted SLDAI. If the forwarding address is a Balancer pool, the pool accumulates more SLDAI (instead of having a more valuable cDAI), eliminating impermanent loss.You then have the best of both worlds: revenues generated from trading fees PLUS revenues generated from lending platforms, without impermanent loss.So composability comes in two different flavors: you can use any building block to throw into a pool, and you can also use the private pools as building blocks for more elaborate constructs on top.FollowTheChain:By ""on top"" I mean the different ways a smart contract can control that private pool, as mentioned in this replied msg.Anonymous:How does smart order routing work in Balancer?Fernando:We have an efficient algo that uses some mathematical simplifications to solve the multi-variable non-linear optimization problem of choosing what is the best combination of pools to trade with and how much the trader should trade with each pool.Fernando:The idea is that by taking all pools you trade with to the same price point you are not leaving money on the table for arb traders to profit. You can prove that by taking different pools to the same price point the trade is equivalent to trading with only one pool with the combined liquidity of all pools. Does that make sense?Anonymous:Yup, thanks!Anonymous:That's neat. The added complexity highlights the importance of transparency to help Balancer participants understand holdings, prices, and risk profiles of these assets at various levels of aggregation. So at scale, that design may trigger modularity related network effects.FollowTheChain:I agree. For instance: some people may feel Compound is not decentralized enough and choose another lending protocol to build that wrapper contract I mentioned. Anyone will be free to participate as a liquidity provider in the pools they feel comfortable with, taking everything into account: expected impermanent loss, trading fee, exit fee, governance of the pool (if not a shared pool), exposure to other building blocks failing, etc. As expected, there will be trade-offs and different risk profiles.Anonymous:This has  been a fantastic back and forth, thanks from all the lurkers like me.Fernando:Thanks, glad you are around! To other lurkers, please don't be shy =)Anonymous:+1, thanks guys 🙂Fernando:Thanks for having us!Anonymous:My hallucination is that ETFs are to index funds what Balancer might be to DEXs. The technology is different but ETFs introduced create/redeem related liquidity and more real time pricing features that index funds didn't have. If Balancer succeeds in solving liquidity and other ineficiencies, do you envision a world where DEXs as we know them today are obsolete?Anonymous:The largest Uniswap pools today are Dai/Eth, Mkr/Eth, USDC/Eth, etc. — do you expect Balancer to compete with Uniswap for those same pools when it launches? If so, why might they choose one over the other? If not, why?Fernando:We believe there is room for conventional DEXs and also Balancer/Uniswap. There are a set of trade-offs that will lead different traders to different options of decentralized liquidity.Fernando:My feeling is that Balancer pools that differentiate themselves from existing Uniswap pools in a smart way (in terms of fees, combination of token types etc) are the ones that will be most likely to succeed in attracting liquidity.Moderator:Makes sense. 10-minute warning for everyone, get your questions in!FollowTheChain:In a scenario where a lot of real-world financial instruments start to be tokenized, and blockchains start to scale and have a UX that can reach wider audiences (I admit this could be a 10+ yrs future), maybe Balancer could become the underlying protocol for liquidity provision and trading of such instruments as well (not just today's tokens). In short: it could grow out of the cryptosphere when blockchains mature. 💭Moderator:As we wrap up here guys, can you walk us through Balancer's launch schedule?Fernando:Our expectation is to launch by the end of the year. This will of course depend on the results of audits we are already starting to have.Moderator:Great 👍Last questions?Anonymous:Thanks team!Moderator:Alright everyone, please give a big thank you to Fernando and FollowTheChain for coming on today!Guys, what's the best way to get in touch + stay up to date with Balancer?Fernando:Thanks everyone!If you are interested in knowing more please follow us on twitter: @BalancerLabsAnonymous:Thanks so much Fernando and FollowTheChainFollowTheChain:Thanks everyone!Moderator:Great.

I recommend reading this short (4-min) article from Eric about EIP 1559, as a precursor to this article.👉Read Eric’s EIP article (4 mins)EIP 1559 does two main things:Establishes “the market rate” for block inclusionBurns the majority of the ETH in the transaction feeThis change to Ethereum’s gas management has significant implications to the monetary system of Ethereum, which is explained in this article. EIP 1559 is the final piece of the puzzle in Ethereum’s monetary policy.Burning the bulk of the ETH in transaction fee:Provides a deflationary mechanism to Ether’s supply, which adds to the scarcity of Ether and long-term security of Ethereum.Benefits all Ether holders equally, rather than exclusively benefiting validators.The purpose of EIP 1559, according to Eric Conner, is to provide wallets and users a much needed improvement to the user-experience of gas management. Knowing how much to spend on gas in order to pay for one’s transaction is a UX issue that plagues Ethereum. Eric (rightfully) claims that the auction-style mechanism is highly inefficient and leads to gross-overpayment to validators. EIP 1559 and its BASEFEE mechanism was designed specifically to address this.However, EIP 1559 is much bigger than that. The way that EIP 1559 solves the gas-management problem also improves Ethereum’s monetary management system. EIP 1559 ‘completes the circle’, ‘finishes’, or ‘syncs up’ Ethereum’s monetary policy to what it should be:A recreation of a traditional nation-state economic system, but replacing the nation state with code.This has always been Ethereum’s primary goal; to create an alternative economic system on the internet. Using code, we can design for the same institutions found in the traditional world (banks, credit-markets, borrowing/lending institutions, exchanges) but on Ethereum. Importantly, we can design them without the need for human involvement, removing the need for bureaucracy, management, oversight, or rent-seeking.What EIP 1559 actually does:Algorithmic gas estimation: ‘The Market-Rate for Gas’Using a system that is comparable to Bitcoin’s difficulty adjustment, EIP 1559 increases or decreases a number, a ‘BASEFEE’, based on the current levels of congestion on Ethereum. If Ethereum is greater than 50% utilized, BASEFEE automatically increases; if it is less than 50% utilized, BASEFEE decreases.BASEFEE attempts to generate “the market rate” for gas prices, natively on Ethereum. While we can see the typical rates that are being paid on websites like EthGasStation.Info, or Etherscan’s Gas Price Tracker, these are 3rd party gas-market estimations. Additionally, they also do not illustrate the level of overpayment for gas fees. BASEFEE formalizes the “going market rate” for block-inclusion, removing the need for each and every wallets to generate their own individual gas estimation strategies. This will allow users to just press “Send Transaction”, and not have to be presented with ‘gas’.When it comes to getting your transaction through quickly, users can still “jump the line” by paying a ‘tip’ to the validators. This ‘tip’ serves the purpose that gas-auction does in today’s version of Ethereum; by ordering transaction inclusion based on tip size. Those that ‘tip’ higher get served first. The tip is what is paid to validators.In times of high network usage, a user can ensure that their transaction is included sooner by including a larger tip along with the BASEFEE amount. Meanwhile, users who are not in a hurry can set a maximum fee that they’re willing to pay. The protocol will then wait for the BASEFEE to drop below this number before confirming their transaction.” — Eric ConnerBurning BASEFEE Burns ETHBASEFEE is BURNT. No-one receives BASEFEE.Burning this is important because it prevents miners from manipulating the fee in order to extract more fees from users.

It also ensures that only ETH can ever be used to pay for transactions on Ethereum, cementing the economic value of ETH within the Ethereum platform.

— Eric ConnerBurning BASEFEE removes the ability for validators to manipulate the fee market for their benefit. It also ‘locks-in’ Ether as the native currency of Ethereum, as it should be. No other currency on Ethereum can be used to pay for transactions. This is comparable to a nation-state demanding that only their native currency be legal tender.Paying Fees to ‘Ethereum’Burning ETH in transaction fees is a simple way to pay Ethereum for its blockspace. In the Ethereum 1.x/Bitcoin model, 100% of the fees are paid to the validators of the chain. This adds to the security of the chain, as there is more revenue that make mining/validating profitable. However, if the chain is overpaying for security, then those funds were much better used elsewhere.Two Core ValuesEthereum has two core values that play off of each-other.Ethereum’s monetary policy is to prioritize securityMinimal viable issuance to achieve securityEthereum prioritizes security above all else. This is why Ethereum has chosen to fund security with block-rewards rather than fee market like Bitcoin. Funding security with block-rewards means that Ethereum’s security will never be 100% reliant on transaction fees for its security; Ethereum pays for its security ahead of time.Here’s a chart, developed by Ethhub.io, that shows how much stakers will receive, based on how much total ETH is being staked (its a dynamic number: more total ETH staked, less paid per ETH. Less total ETH staked, more paid per ETH)Ethereum doesn’t depend on fees for economic security. Ethereum guarantees a security budget to pay validators with block-rewards.Because Ethereum pays validators by block rewards, also paying them BASEFEE would be overpaying for security. Validators are employees to Ethereum, and when Ethereum generates extra revenue, there is no reason as to why the employees should be paid this extra revenue. That revenue is paid to the business. The Employees are free to keep the tips that are placed in the tip-jar, for serving the highest paying customers first, but BASEFEE belongs to the network.Burning ETH = Paying the NetworkThe title of this section has Ethereum in air-quotes for a reason. If we’re not paying BASEFEE to the validators, who should get it?Burning BASEFEE pays everyone, equally. Whether you are Staking your ETH, or have it inside of MakerDAO, Uniswap, Augur, in your wallet, in a game, BASEFEE is paid to your ETH. If you hold ETH, you receive BASEFEE indirectly.This is similar to how MKR holders receive the Stability Fee in MakerDAO; the SF burns MKR from the interest payments of those with debt to MakerDAO. If you hold MKR, your share of MKR is increasing due to the burning of MKR that isn’t yours.By burning ETH, all Ethereum stakeholders benefit. EIP 1559 is solves a “tragedy of the commons” problem in Ethereum, by paying for one’s externalities by adding to the scarcity of Ether.After staking, holding Ether and keeping it off the secondary market is the second-best way to add to the security of Ethereum. BASEFEE is the mechanism to which these Ethereum stakeholders benefit from the growth of Ethereum at large.When the U.S. government pulls in more revenue from taxes, it spends more. When Ethereum pulls in more revenue from gas fees, it issues a stock-buyback.Burning BASEFEE is Paying for Future SecurityEvery day that Ethereum runs, BASEFEE will remove more and more ETH from the supply. The BASEFEE amount that Ethereum could have paid directly to validators, instead is being paid to ‘Future Ethereum’.The ability to attack Ethereum 2.0 will be a function of how much ETH is available for purchase on the secondary markets. If there is high ETH supply on the market, then buying enough to attack Ethereum is less expensive. If there is low ETH supply on the secondary market, then the price is higher, and attacking Ethereum requires much more capital.By adding to the scarcity of Ethereum today, Ethereum’s security tomorrow is secured.EIP 1559 puts constant downwards pressure on the supply of ETH. When Ethereum brings in little revenue, there is little downwards pressure, but when Ethereum is a fully-fledged economy, moving trillions of USD-value each day, and has the throughput of 1024x shards, the burn-rate of ETH could become significant.Reducing Inflation, based on Aggregate SpendingEIP 1559 will introduce 2 new metrics to add to the list of the growing number of Ethereum economy metrics: The ETH-Burn Rate, and the ETH Burn:Issue Rate Ratio.ETH Stake RateETH Issuance RateETH Locked in Open FinanceDai Savings RateDai Average Borrow/Supply RateETH Burn RateETH Issue:Burn RatioThe ETH Burn Rate tracks the scale of the Ethereum economy. As economic activity on Ethereum grows, the ETH Burn Rate will follow it. The ETH Issue:Burn Ratio is a metric that shows the trend of ETH scarcity. If the ratio is below 1, then ETH supply is decreasing.How much could EIP 1559 burn relative to total issuance?Modeling how much ETH could actually be burnt is a little premature. Having 1024x the transaction capacity makes the economics of Ethereum 2.0 wholly different than Ethereum 1.xHowever, we can do some napkin math.It’s a well-articulated goal for Ethereum 2.0 that 10M total ETH staking is desirable. At this number of total ETH staking, Ethereum is issuing 1550 ETH/Day.Ethereum 2.0 will have 1024x shards, at 15 TPS each (current TPS of Ethereum 1.x). This is 22M transactions / day.In order to burn 1550 ETH/Day to cancel out issuance, BASEFEE would need to be 0.00007045 ETH per transaction. To compare, a simple-ETH send costs 0.000021, at 1-Gwei gas price.These calculations are extremely rough, and we will have much more data when Ethereum’s economic system is fully operational in Ethereum 2.0. Many variables go into this calculation, including changes to how gas is calculated and overall network congestion at scale.EIP 1559 = Ethereum’s Taxation SystemIf there is one thing that the reader walks away from this article with, I hope it is this: EIP 1559 represents Ethereum’s taxation system.Ethereum is a permissionless cyber-economy. It is like a nation-state economy, except all human input/coordination/governance/politics has been replaced by code. The U.S. Dollar economy, the most successful economy ever on Earth, presents a model for how the ideal economy is structured. Ethereum takes that model, and commits it to code, enabling a digital value layer on-top of the internet.The primary purpose of Ethereum is to establish a digitally native permissionless economy. Thousands of years of economic experimentation has lead to the U.S. economy proving to be the most successful economy humans have ever come up with.Not without its flaws, however.The Dollar is determined by the Fed to lose 2+% every single year, making it a less-than-ideal money. The Fed will print whatever USD necessary to make USD lose 2% every year.The bond-market can change in a heartbeat, based on trust in the U.S. government. If the U.S. hints that it can’t/won’t pay its debts, the value of the bond market will change accordingly.The IRS collects taxes in order to support the economy. But thats a terribly bureaucratic system, and the rich all find ways to pay the minimum amount of taxes, leaving the working-class to pay far more than their fair share of taxes. Additionally, ‘who pays how much in taxes’ is a question with significant baggage. Everyone wants everyone else to pay them.Each part of the Ethereum economic system takes the legacy system, and commits it to agnostic, apolitical, human-less code.The Economy = Applications. Applications like MakerDAO, Uniswap, Compound, Augur, dYdX etc have either mitigated or totally eliminated human engagement. The 2008 financial crises came from permissioned ledgers and false reporting. Ethereum applications have no such capacity.The bond market = the ETH-Stake Rate. There is never any doubt that the protocol cannot pay for its maintenance; it’s built into the code. Complete-assurance of the capacity to pay. Trust in the U.S. government is subjective; trust in Ethereum can be verified by viewing the code.The IRS = EIP 1559. No more “who should pay more/less in taxes?”. The rich can’t use their influence to change tax policy for their advantage. In Ethereum, users pay-per-use of the network, and all users are taxed equally. No individual will ever pay more or less in taxes than any other individual, per their use of the network.EIP 1559 is the last piece of Ethereum’s economic system. The interesting thing is that it was generated with the purpose to make Ethereum’s gas-markets more efficient and user-friendly; the result, however, is an integral component of a functioning economic system. EIP 1559 is one of the many parts of Ethereum that is designed to be human and politically agnostic, as all money and monetary systems should be.EIP 1559 does one thing very well: It ensures that all ETH holders capture the value of Ethereum, by default. Without EIP 1559, applications that don’t leverage Ether as a reserve asset (applications like Tether, Bancor, any off-chain asset etc.) still add to the value of ETH, by burning ETH to pay for their economic activity on Ethereum. EIP 1559 makes all usage of Ethereum directly add to the scarcity of Ether. No longer do you need to be an ETH-Staker in order to be exposed to the upside of the growth of the Ethereum economic system.All you need to do is hold ETH.ETH is the best model for money we have ever come up with.Action stepsConsider: what’s the effect of EIP 1559 on the scarcity & moneyness of ETH?Learn more about ETH’s monetary policy & issuance schedule at EthHubLevel up—no interruption. $12 per mo.

If you disagree and can articulate your disagreement you’re probably leveling up even faster.So maybe I’m secretly hoping you disagree with this. 😉- RSATHURSDAY THOUGHTWhat is monetary policy in crypto?Crypto appropriated the term monetary policy from central bankers. To bankers, monetary policy is how a country sets interest rates and money supply to grow GDP, manage employment, and maintain predictable exchange rates—all without overly high rates of inflation.Crypto monies don’t have a mandate involving GDP or employment—their issuance schedule is blind to these. This makes their supply as immune to political pressures as gold is. Gold and crypto: non-sovereign assets. But unlike gold, crypto actually does have a monetary policy mandate: to maximally secure the network.Gold is secured by chemical bonds forged from the energy output of a supernova. Not crypto—crypto is a product of human design—security comes from the economic value placed on the crypto asset itself and the accompanying monetary policy of its network.Fiat money and crypto money have different mandates:Policy mandate of fiat: GDP, employment, exchange—without hyperinflationPolicy mandate of crypto: to secure the networkI’m going to keep using the term monetary policy for BTC and ETH, but issuance policy is probably more accurate given the difference in mandate. I might even prefer the term security policy since that is true goal.What secures BTC and ETH?Let’s back up for a second and discuss how BTC and ETH are secured.The security of these networks is based on economic incentives. Without strong economics they’re susceptible to attack.A 51-percent attacker for instance, can reverse transactions—steal money—in either network. An attack of this type just requires control of 51-percent of the capital securing the network. In the case of proof-of-work, the capital is hardware and energy. In the case of proof-of-stake, the capital is ETH tokens. Good security for these networks means making the cost of attack higher than the value they secure.The difference between a high value and a low value chain can be seen in settlement time. Coinbase is willing to settle transfers of BTC in 6 confirmations—an hour. But a  lower value chain like BSV chain requires 1,008 confirmations—7 days to settle! Coinbase requires more from BSV to protect itself from theft by 51-attackers.But wait a second—why is all this capital being put to work to secure the network in the first place? Again we’re back to incentives: miners are investing capital to secure Bitcoin and Ethereum because they’re paid to do it. They’re in it to make money.Their security revenue comes from two sources:Block rewards—they earn all new BTC and ETH coins that are mintedTransaction fees—they earn fees from users paying for transactionsThe sum of these is miner revenue. And miner revenue is equal to security budget.Would an analogy help?Imagine a nation-state that both mints new money each year and collects taxes on economic transactions to pay for its national defense. That’s what BTC and ETH are doing. The new money is block rewards, the taxes are transaction fees, the sum of which is the security budget that pays for the military—the military is the miners.Most security comes from block rewardsNow the bulk of the security budget, I’m talking about 95% to 99% comes from block rewards not transaction fees. This is true for both networks.What portion of mining revenue comes from block rewards vs transaction fees?Good thing you’ve already leveled up and know how to read onchain data to find the answer to this. You can see the difference between block reward revenue and transaction fee revenue in BTC and ETH under the “Mining Revenue” metric.You’ll notice that block reward revenue increases as the value of BTC and ETH increases. That’s because block rewards are denominated in BTC and ETH while miner capital costs is usually measured in USD. So if I earn a 2 ETH block reward as a miner my revenue is double when the price of ETH is $400 vs. when the price of ETH is $200.And what makes ETH double in price? Demand for ETH as an asset.Transaction fee revenue is different. Doubling the price of BTC or ETH as an asset doesn’t double transaction fee revenue. Transaction fees only increase when the demand to use Bitcoin and Ethereum transactions increases—blockspace demand and asset demand are separate things. This goes back to a core insight we’ve talked about before—the asset is not the network—they’re two different markets.Ok, so security budget is mostly block reward revenue that’s driven by the demand for BTC and ETH as assets. So how does this tie back to BTC monetary policy?Issuance and SecurityYou probably know Bitcoin’s issuance schedule. Really simple. Block rewards started high and are cut in half every four years.2012: 25 BTC per block2016: 12.5 BTC per block 👈we are here2020: 6.5 BTC per block2024: 3.1 BTC per block2028: 1.7 BTC per block2032: .78 BTC per blockAnd so on as it approaches 0.This monetary policy was baked into the Bitcoin design from the beginning. It’s enforced by code and upheld through strong social social consensus. Really hard to change. Really clear narrative.Remember the single mandate of a crypto monetary policy? To maximally secure the network. The scarcity narrative—only 21m Bitcoin—has worked wonderfully to maximally secure the Bitcoin network so far. Why? Because in its early early years Bitcoin’s network security is highly subsidized by block reward revenue. Block reward revenue increases with demand for BTC. And demand for BTC increases with a scarcity narrative. And the scarcity narrative is perpetuated by a monetary policy that decreases block rewards. A virtuous cycle.This is Bitcoin’s great strength.But there’s also a flaw.With each halving this great strength is used less in the security of the network. Each halving cuts the security budget subsidy making Bitcoin’s security less reliant on the price of BTC and more reliant on demand for Bitcoin blockspace.Bitcoin eventually becomes almost entirely reliant on blockspace demand—by 2032 BTC-denominated block rewards will be only 6% of today’s rewards. Yes, we can assume BTC will have appreciated between now and then—for example, if price rises to $140k per BTC then 2019 level security budget may be maintained. But is 2019-level security enough for a multi-trillion dollar network?And what happens when the rest of the block reward subsidy is taken away?Hasu and others recently wrote an excellent paper enumerating future solutions to the problem of decreasing block rewards. One of which is to alter Bitcoin’s monetary policy to add perpetual inflation—more than 21m BTCs—no fixed cap on supply. An action like this would almost certainly cause a fork. Further, it’s likely to harm the scarcity and immutability narrative which some argue is Bitcoin’s reason for existence.Others assume transaction fee revenue in Bitcoin will pick up the slack. I’m far less convinced. It’s not clear that blockspace demand is Bitcoin’s core strength. Even today, Ethereum is neck-in-neck with Bitcoin on transaction fee revenue. This is because Ethereum serves as a settlement network for a multitude of digital assets and money protocols—due to this broader use, I wouldn’t be surprised if Ethereum exceeds Bitcoin in transaction fee revenue in the years to come.Overrating BTC’s monetary policyThe people overrating BTC’s monetary policy are those that treat it as the incarnation of perfection. It’s not perfect. The fixed cap monetary policy of Bitcoin makes  tradeoffs:Fixed cap strengths—scarcity narrative, perceived predictability, & perceived immutability—this drives value to BTC and higher block reward revenueFixed cap weaknesses—block reward reduction may lead to a lower security than alternatives and may require an alteration to monetary policyUnder this lens, you could argue Bitcoin’s monetary policy is front-loading its short to medium-term network security at the cost of its long-term network security. This could be the right play—capture network effects through scarcity narrative and bootstrap your way to liquidity domination. But Ethereum is taking a different approach. One with a different set of tradeoffs—certainly with weakness, but also with under appreciated strengths.We’ll explore Ethereum’s monetary policy tradeoffs in the next article of this two-part series.

Subscribe to the Bankless program below. Remember—no Market Monday next week. You’re off for the holidays.Dear Crypto Natives,There are three beliefs about crypto:It’s useless and will collapse to zeroIt’ll go mainstream and grow to trillionsIt’s a niche product for a shadow economyI give the first a very slim chance of happening at this point. The second is the crypto money bet we’re making. But what about the third? Maybe crypto was never meant to go mainstream as this article argues.“By design, cryptocurrency does not solve mainstream problems.”I understand the argument. That censorship resistance is the primary value proposition of cryptocurrency and thus its use is “primarily to engage in illegal or socially unacceptable activities”—but the argument is short-sighted. Myopic.Don’t get me wrong. Censorship resistance is essential. So is decentralization. Projects that dilute these attributes tend to destroy the thing that makes their crypto networks useful. But even these attributes aren’t the killer feature.You know what is?Permissionless innovation.Permissionless is the killer feature.Permissionless means a million developers can build on these money protocols without needing to ask the incumbents. It removes barriers to entry. It levels the playing field. It means a kid with a laptop and some Solidity experience can disrupt the business model of a multi-national bank.Anyone in the world can transfer value just like anyone in the world can send email.Anyone in the world can issue a scarce asset just like anyone in the world can start blog.Anyone in the world can create a capital pool, or an exchange, or a loan, or a synthetic.Are you a developer? You now have superpowers. A set of programmable money legos at your disposal.Are you an entrepreneur? There’s a blank slate of opportunities to discover. Look at CZ. In two years he built a businesses that now has half a billion in annual profits—a global bank built on permissionless money protocols.Permissionless eats the world.I’m fortunate enough to live in a region with high relative freedoms. I’m not a dissident or a freedom fighter or a criminal. I have access to banks accounts and the best financial markets in the world.But…I can’t withdraw more than $300 in cash from the ATM per day.I can’t transfer more than $6k per month from my bank account.I can’t free my IRA from my brokerage account w/o 3 weeks and 5 phone calls.But I can transfer any amount, any time, to anyone in the world in a few minutes for a few cents with crypto.Crypto already provides better user experience than my 1st-world banks:I prefer Coinbase to eTradeI prefer USDC at 4% interest vs USD at 1.5%I prefer an Eth address with Zerion to WellsFargoI prefer opening a Maker Vault to opening a line of creditI prefer paying contractors in DAI to paying them in physical cashThese were are all made possible by permissionless innovation. Builders and entrepreneurs created these apps using crypto protocols as their foundation.People have trouble extrapolating the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th order effects of permissionless protocols. We couldn’t predict Facebook in 1993. We couldn’t foresee Uber in 2003. The protocols keep surprising us. And crypto will be no different.You can’t put it in a box.The internet is a set of communication protocols. Yes, it allows you to send a censorship resistant electronic message around the world in seconds—yes, its used by drug lords and terrorists and by freedom fighters resisting authoritarian regimes. But it also gave superpowers to entrepreneurs and builders. It helped them compete in new ways against incumbents and build mainstream systems for the world.It gave anyone the power to launch a website, or a store, or a YouTube stream.Permissionless is the killer feature of the internet.Crypto is just an extension of the internet. It’s adds digital scarcity to the web. Yes, it’s a technology for the fringes of society, but it’s not just for them. It’s for everyone.Crypto is for mainstream.And the day is coming when mainstream will prefer it to traditional banks.Stay tuned here to see it happen.- RSAETH futures launching tomorrow, large financial institutions like ING continue to enter, money protocols maturing slowly—all that’s missing in crypto is new buyersMARKET MONDAY:Scan this section and dig into anything interestingMarket numbersETH tumbles to $132 from $146 last MondayBTC falls to $6,880 from $7,302 last MondayMaker SAI fee down to 3%—DAI fee steady at 4% with savings rate 4% tooMarket opportunities(Earn) 4% on your DAI by depositing it into the Dai Savings rate at 4% (still 🔥)(Lend) Handy dashboard showing you DeFi lending rates(Trade) using Kraken’s newly listed DAI/BTC pair(Invest) 60 ETH/40 USD RSI Set but while in USD you’re earning interest(Trade) ETH Futures on ErisX!

(10 minutes) This week I want to introduce you to the new money protocol I’ve been so excited about over the past couple weeks. This is a live, mainnet release of ERC1620—the world's first money streaming protocol. (Can your bank do this?) In tomorrow’s tactic we’re going to cover everything you can do with this new money streaming protocol.But first I want you to try it out in today’s assignment. Here’s how:Go to https://pay.sablier.finance/Sign in with your wallet of choice: 
MetaMask, Wallet Connect or Coinbase Wallet.Make sure to have some Ether and Dai (get it on Uniswap).Tap the “Stream Money” button.Select Dai as the streaming currency.Type the amount of money you want to stream, e.g. 25 Dai.Type the ENS name or Ethereum address of one of your friends
(I’m RSA.eth if you want to test a few cents)Select the duration of the stream. It can be anything from 1 minute up to 1 year.Submit the form and set a gas price slightly higher than the standard gas price on EthGasStation.

What do you think of the MetaCartel Ventures (MCV) DAO paper that was released last week?

RSA Response:
I think it’s interesting.The idea is to create an on-chain capital pool managed by contributors that invests in crypto projects for fun, profit, and alpha. This is the first for-profit DAO on Ethereum I’ve seen since TheDAO.The idea is simple: investors contribute ETH to the pool and earn a proportional right to future cash flows. They also earn a right to vote on proposals—that is, they vote to decide which investments the DAO should make.The structure of the MCV DAO is based on MolochDAO and thus includes the ever-important RageQuit function. This allows investors to exit from (or be kicked out of) the DAO for any reason and at any time, but still receive their fair portion of current treasury and future cash flows upon departure.The big iteration here—this DAO is legally compliant. Each DAO token is mirrored as a membership interest in a Delaware LLC legal structure so ultimately, the settlement layer is the U.S. legal system.There are upsides to this: it provides liability protection to DAO contributors, it clarifies taxes, it creates a recognized legal entity—a form of interoperability between code-law of Ethereum and meatspace law of the U.S. government.There are also downsides: only accredited investors can enter, it’s quite clearly a security under (perhaps unavoidable?), it’s a new and untested crypto-legal structure.The question is my mind: what’s the advantage to this form of capital pool?Coordination? Is management of a capital through mages, goblins, and summoners better?Open participation? Probably not in this version—only open to accredited investorsMechanism? The RageQuit mechanism is new—yes, this could be importantTransparency? I’m not sure if transparency is a help or hinderance a private capital poolOne of the most interesting parts—there’s no need for a bank. Just ETH, DAI, and a smart-contract to hold the money.Overall I’m undecided on the advantages of this particular iteration. I expect the investment results of MVC DAO will depend an awful lot on the leaders and investors within the pool. Not very different from traditional capital pools on that count. At the end of the day, this is a tokenized LLC investment pool with shareholder governance by private key vote (and a cool rage quit function).I am optimistic about the experimentation itself however. If this takes off, it’s a real world test of the first hybrid legal-crypto capital pool—another iteration in a long-line of DAO experiments to be run. And we learn something every time.It’s like many things in crypto—the biggest upside of participation today is learning for tomorrow.- RSASome recent tweets…

Isn’t ETH’s trustless economic bandwidth going to get swallowed up when BTC comes to Ethereum?RSA answer:
I lean no! Here are the ways to get BTC on Ethereum today:Custodied: like wBTC wrapped by BitGoBonded: like tBTC by Keep or zBTC by RENSynthetic: imagine if Maker launched a Maker-BTC backed by collateralLet's go though them.Custodied is trusted, no comparison. Skip.Bonded requires trustless economic bandwidth! In the tBTC design, every 1 BTC must be backed by at least 100% of its value in an ETH bond, this collateral economically secures the tBTC on ETH. If tBTC got popular it would be a large consumer of ETH bandwidth—further strengthening ETH.In the zBTC design, instead of using ETH as a bond for economic security, zBTC uses the REN token. This means REN must be 3x the value of any zBTC it secures, or else the zBTC can be stolen. REN may be able to bootstrap itself to a decent market cap but it’ll be hard to compete with the economic bandwidth of more widely used assets like BTC and ETH. (And if security of zBTC depends on REN we have to ask—how trustless is REN?)Lastly, a synthetic Bitcoin that Maker might create would have similar dynamics as DAI. It could be backed in part by trusted collateral—but the more trusted the collateral, the fewer trustless properties it preserves. To remain maximally trustless, a Maker-BTC would need to maximally use ETH as collateral.So all the BTC on Ethereum designs I've seem to require an awful lot of ETH as economic bandwidth. This demand would just increase ETH’s bandwidth!The greater threat to ETH is the possibility that people don’t care about trustless economic bandwidth. They're fine with trusted bandwidth—in that world a wBTC, a Coinbase issued USDC, or a tokenize T-bills can serve collateral.But in that world, what's the point of crypto at all?- RSASome recent tweets…ActionsExecute any good market opportunities you sawComplete weekly assignment: send DAI to 10 people in 1 transactionLevel up—no interruption. $12 per mo.

THURSDAY THOUGHTCustodial staking in Ethereum 2Post by: Jim McDonald, co-founder of AttestantEthereum 2 staking is on the horizon and a great opportunity to put otherwise-dormant Ether to work. A number of exchanges and custodians have announced they will start providing interest on Ether held in custody. Is this free money, or is there a catch?Basics of Ethereum stakingEthereum 2 is due to launch in the second half of this year. Although hardly the first cryptocurrency to use proof of stake as a mechanism to secure its chain, it is by far the largest and for many will be an introduction to proof of stake with a currency they personally hold.The basics of staking with Ethereum 2 are relatively simple: you deposit 32 Ether into a ""staking contract"" on the Ethereum 1 chain to become a validator on the Ethereum 2 chain.

On the surface this sounds very attractive for everyone. Your money grows while being held in custody, the custodian is paid by the network for participating in validating rather than taking a percentage of your assets, and the Ethereum 2 network improves its security the more Ether is staked with it. What's not to like?Well, there are a few catches when staking with Ethereum 2 that are worth understanding, especially those in the short- and mid-term (i.e. next couple of years) before the Ethereum 2 network matures.Risk of fractional reservePerhaps most importantly, in the initial release of Ethereum 2, there is no mechanism for transferring staked Ether to another account, or even back to the Ethereum 1 chain. This very much locks in your Ether; there is literally nothing else you can do with it. However, this also means that any staked Ether cannot be returned to the owner and remains locked in to the Ethereum 2 chain. This creates a fractional reserve system: if, for example, 50% of the Ether held by a custodian is being used for staking then, at most, only 50% of the Ether cumulatively held by owners can be returned to them. If Ether makes a sudden price movement that results in a request for much of the Ether to be returned, this could put strain on the custodian. Crypto is a skittish world, and any idea of a custodian being unable to return all of its customers' Ether may prompt the type of bank run we've seen in the past in both crypto and fiat worlds.Moreover, a custodian might be tempted to move more and more Ether from cold storage to staking in order to make more ‘free money’ gains. This would result in a reduced fractional reserve in the chase for profit (sound familiar?).Risk of slashingA separate security issue arises from the fact that validating in Ethereum 2 is an active process, which means that Ether used for staking is protected by keys that are “hot”. The design of Ethereum 2 is such that there is a separate ""withdrawal key"" that controls movement of the Ether, which can be placed in cold storage, but there remains a ""validator key"" that is required to be used every 6 minutes or so, and so cannot be placed in cold storage. If the validator key is compromised the funds can be destroyed by a process known as ""slashing"". Alternatively, an attacker could blackmail the custodian, threatening to destroy the funds unless the custodian pays them a ransom. In both situations, a custodian could suffer significant damage in both monetary and reputational terms.The custodian also has to be capable of running a staking operation. Staking in Ethereum 2 is neither free nor simple, and requires both understanding and on-going effort on the part of the custodian to be successful. Failure to operate correctly can result in financial penalties being applied to the validator.So we have two sources of risk with custodians staking Ether: the custodian over-staking resulting in a shortage of Ether to pay back to its owners, and the danger of running an inefficient, insecure, or non-optimal staking process resulting in lower (or negative) interest.What if custodians tokenize staked ETH?Tokenization is often touted as a solution in such situations: could issuing a token in lieu of staked Ether be a solution to the problems with fractional reserve? Unfortunately not, for a couple of reasons. First, this could be looked upon as a disposal of Ether, which has tax implications in many jurisdictions. Second, the value of such tokens would very much be tied to the risks and reputation of the custodian. As such, the value of such a token would likely be at a steep discount to the Ether it represents, and who would want to own that?Is custodial staking bad?All this said, custodial staking is not an inherently bad thing and the aforementioned benefits to owners and custodians, as well as the network itself, are real. So what is the way forward? In a word: transparency.Most importantly, staking should be offered as a product separate to any existing custody service, with clear information about its longer-term outlook and lock-up requirements. Custodial services should be clear from the outset on the % of Ether under management that they are staking on behalf of their customers. They should have up-to-date information on the current rewards they have made to date on staked Ether. And they should have contingency plans in place to allow them to cover their Ether position in case there is a higher than expected demand for withdrawals.Over time these problems are likely to go away: as the Ethereum 2 network matures it will become easy (if never quick) to move Ether in and out of staking positions, and custodians will develop and learn the financial and technical rules to provide safe staking with suitable capital adequacy requirements. Until then, make sure that your custodian gives you suitable visibility and control. That way, you can benefit from staking without finding yourself unexpectedly cut off from your funds, and custodians can benefit from staking rewards without suffering monetary and reputational damage, whilst boosting the security and stability of the Ethereum 2 network.Action stepsWhat are the two risks of custodial staking this article highlights?What’s your take: is custodial staking good or bad for Ethereum?Author BlubJim McDonald has been involved in technology for over 30 years, and is more excited about blockchain than any technology he’s seen before.  He has built blockchain products from an early Bitcoin explorer to an Ethereum 2 wallet, and is a co-founder of Attestant, which provides managed validator services for Ethereum 2.BONUS ROUND: Three Followup Questions for JimMy follow up questions for Jim after reading this articleSubscribe to Bankless. $12 per mo.

THURSDAY THOUGHTCustodial staking in Ethereum 2Post by: Jim McDonald, co-founder of AttestantEthereum 2 staking is on the horizon and a great opportunity to put otherwise-dormant Ether to work. A number of exchanges and custodians have announced they will start providing interest on Ether held in custody. Is this free money, or is there a catch?Basics of Ethereum stakingEthereum 2 is due to launch in the second half of this year. Although hardly the first cryptocurrency to use proof of stake as a mechanism to secure its chain, it is by far the largest and for many will be an introduction to proof of stake with a currency they personally hold.The basics of staking with Ethereum 2 are relatively simple: you deposit 32 Ether into a ""staking contract"" on the Ethereum 1 chain to become a validator on the Ethereum 2 chain. To validate, you run a computer program to either propose new blocks in the chain or vote to affirm that blocks proposed by other validators are valid. If you do a good job, you are rewarded with additional Ether; if you do not, some of your Ether is forfeited.Validating in Ethereum 2 has no credit risk: there is no chance of the Ethereum 2 network failing to meet its obligations to give rewards or return staked Ether. This makes validating an inherently safer way to earn with your Ether, as opposed to lending it out via a DeFi platform. With lower risk comes lower reward: staked Ether is expected to earn somewhere between 3% and 8% p.a., depending on the total amount of Ether staked by all validators. Not the big double-digit returns that some products might offer, but still a not inconsiderable amount.Benefits & risks of staking with a custodianIf staking with a custodian, the custodian uses your Ether as a stake so it can participate in validating, earning rewards and passing a portion back to you. On the surface this sounds very attractive for everyone. Your money grows while being held in custody, the custodian is paid by the network for participating in validating rather than taking a percentage of your assets, and the Ethereum 2 network improves its security the more Ether is staked with it. What's not to like?Well, there are a few catches when staking with Ethereum 2 that are worth understanding, especially those in the short- and mid-term (i.e. next couple of years) before the Ethereum 2 network matures.Risk of fractional reservePerhaps most importantly, in the initial release of Ethereum 2, there is no mechanism for transferring staked Ether to another account, or even back to the Ethereum 1 chain. This very much locks in your Ether; there is literally nothing else you can do with it.

This would result in a reduced fractional reserve in the chase for profit (sound familiar?).Risk of slashingA separate security issue arises from the fact that validating in Ethereum 2 is an active process, which means that Ether used for staking is protected by keys that are “hot”. The design of Ethereum 2 is such that there is a separate ""withdrawal key"" that controls movement of the Ether, which can be placed in cold storage, but there remains a ""validator key"" that is required to be used every 6 minutes or so, and so cannot be placed in cold storage. If the validator key is compromised the funds can be destroyed by a process known as ""slashing"". Alternatively, an attacker could blackmail the custodian, threatening to destroy the funds unless the custodian pays them a ransom. In both situations, a custodian could suffer significant damage in both monetary and reputational terms.The custodian also has to be capable of running a staking operation. Staking in Ethereum 2 is neither free nor simple, and requires both understanding and on-going effort on the part of the custodian to be successful. Failure to operate correctly can result in financial penalties being applied to the validator.So we have two sources of risk with custodians staking Ether: the custodian over-staking resulting in a shortage of Ether to pay back to its owners, and the danger of running an inefficient, insecure, or non-optimal staking process resulting in lower (or negative) interest.What if custodians tokenize staked ETH?Tokenization is often touted as a solution in such situations: could issuing a token in lieu of staked Ether be a solution to the problems with fractional reserve? Unfortunately not, for a couple of reasons. First, this could be looked upon as a disposal of Ether, which has tax implications in many jurisdictions. Second, the value of such tokens would very much be tied to the risks and reputation of the custodian. As such, the value of such a token would likely be at a steep discount to the Ether it represents, and who would want to own that?Is custodial staking bad?All this said, custodial staking is not an inherently bad thing and the aforementioned benefits to owners and custodians, as well as the network itself, are real. So what is the way forward? In a word: transparency.Most importantly, staking should be offered as a product separate to any existing custody service, with clear information about its longer-term outlook and lock-up requirements. Custodial services should be clear from the outset on the % of Ether under management that they are staking on behalf of their customers. They should have up-to-date information on the current rewards they have made to date on staked Ether. And they should have contingency plans in place to allow them to cover their Ether position in case there is a higher than expected demand for withdrawals.Over time these problems are likely to go away: as the Ethereum 2 network matures it will become easy (if never quick) to move Ether in and out of staking positions, and custodians will develop and learn the financial and technical rules to provide safe staking with suitable capital adequacy requirements. Until then, make sure that your custodian gives you suitable visibility and control. That way, you can benefit from staking without finding yourself unexpectedly cut off from your funds, and custodians can benefit from staking rewards without suffering monetary and reputational damage, whilst boosting the security and stability of the Ethereum 2 network.Action stepsWhat are the two risks of custodial staking this article highlights?What’s your take: is custodial staking good or bad for Ethereum?Author BlubJim McDonald has been involved in technology for over 30 years, and is more excited about blockchain than any technology he’s seen before.  He has built blockchain products from an early Bitcoin explorer to an Ethereum 2 wallet, and is a co-founder of Attestant, which provides managed validator services for Ethereum 2.BONUS ROUND: Three Followup Questions for JimMy follow up questions for Jim after reading this articleSubscribe to Bankless. $12 per mo.

As such, the value of such a token would likely be at a steep discount to the Ether it represents, and who would want to own that?Is custodial staking bad?All this said, custodial staking is not an inherently bad thing and the aforementioned benefits to owners and custodians, as well as the network itself, are real. So what is the way forward? In a word: transparency.Most importantly, staking should be offered as a product separate to any existing custody service, with clear information about its longer-term outlook and lock-up requirements. Custodial services should be clear from the outset on the % of Ether under management that they are staking on behalf of their customers. They should have up-to-date information on the current rewards they have made to date on staked Ether. And they should have contingency plans in place to allow them to cover their Ether position in case there is a higher than expected demand for withdrawals.Over time these problems are likely to go away: as the Ethereum 2 network matures it will become easy (if never quick) to move Ether in and out of staking positions, and custodians will develop and learn the financial and technical rules to provide safe staking with suitable capital adequacy requirements. Until then, make sure that your custodian gives you suitable visibility and control. That way, you can benefit from staking without finding yourself unexpectedly cut off from your funds, and custodians can benefit from staking rewards without suffering monetary and reputational damage, whilst boosting the security and stability of the Ethereum 2 network.Action stepsWhat are the two risks of custodial staking this article highlights?What’s your take: is custodial staking good or bad for Ethereum?Author BlubJim McDonald has been involved in technology for over 30 years, and is more excited about blockchain than any technology he’s seen before.  He has built blockchain products from an early Bitcoin explorer to an Ethereum 2 wallet, and is a co-founder of Attestant, which provides managed validator services for Ethereum 2.BONUS ROUND: Three Followup Questions for JimMy follow up questions for Jim after reading this articleSubscribe to Bankless. $12 per mo.

In today’s fiat currency world, money isn’t actually one definite thing. Usually we talk about money in context of various monetary aggregates, where the individual aggregates have various levels of liquidity and counterparty risk.It’s useful to view today’s money as an inverse layered pyramid:(Above) Bitcoin community focuses mostly on the base money qualities, while Ethereum as a community focuses more on the further aggregates.
At the bottom of the inverse pyramid lies the Monetary base—this is the cash we carry around in our wallets, plus reserves of commercial banks held at the central bank. Monetary base is the narrowest definition of money, as it’s the ultimate clearing instrument: if you hold cash as a citizen or reserve at central bank as a bank, there is no risk of counterparty failure.On the other hand, if you hold a deposit at your bank (as a citizen) or an overnight deposit (as a bank), there is a slight counterparty risk—the depository institution can go insolvent or bankrupt. This is one of the reasons why American commercial banks started to ﻿hoard excess reserves﻿ after the financial crisis, as the trust between the banks evaporated (the other main reason for the sustained high level of excess reserves is the fact Fed started paying an interest on the reserves).The reason for the shape of an inverse pyramid lies in the nature of a fractional reserve system—banks are able to issue loans in multiples of the held reserves, and further aggregates like M2 are mostly based on trust and credit rating of the issuing institutions. The further you move up the aggregate pyramid, the more trust is required and the less liquid (immediately exchangeable for the lesser levels of the pyramid) the assets are.(Fun fact: Ethereum’s aggregates’ pyramid would be in an opposite shape, due to overcollateralization. But this may change in the future if a model of money markets without overcollateralization is developed.)The M1 and further aggregates are what we actually handle most of the transactions with. All over the world, people and businesses handle more and more of the payments via wire transfers and credit/debit cards and less with physical cash.Let’s summarize this section and move on the implications for Bitcoin and Ethereum. We’ve learned that:today’s money has no single definition: it’s a spectrum with various levels of trust and liquidity across individual layerswhile monetary base has least trust assumptions and is the most liquid of the aggregates, M1-M3 is where the monetary utility liesWant an overview of base money and M1-M3?🎙️Listen to “Ether the triple point asset” Episode #4 of the Bankless PodcastBitcoin’s path to moneynessAs I indicated on the monetary aggregates diagram, Bitcoin is mostly focusing on having the solid monetary base first and foremost. Let’s go through the evidence briefly:prevailing hard money narrative and broad popularity of Plan B’s ﻿Stock to flow﻿ model (which is just an applied version of the hard money narrative); halving is one of Bitcoin’s sacred days (others: Pizza day, White paper day, Genesis block day)strong focus and historical success of decentralized governance (﻿UASF﻿ and ﻿No2X﻿ grassroots initiatives)continuing discussion and analysis of Bitcoin’s future security budget (as written on by ﻿Nic Carter﻿, ﻿Dan Held﻿, ﻿Hasu ﻿and ﻿yours truly﻿)payments scalability: startups building on Bitcoin tech stack focus mainly on payments scalability and fungibility improvements (﻿Samourai﻿, ﻿Wasabi﻿, ﻿Strike﻿, ﻿Lightning Labs﻿, ﻿Square Lightning SDK﻿)social scalability: Bitcoin’s focus on store of value and payments aspects may be seen as unambitious, but this focus ensures Bitcoin’s position as a natural ﻿Schelling point﻿ of global non-fiat money; since only soft forks are used to include changes in the protocol, there is little need to pay attention to ongoing governance discussions (with headaches like in what language should the discussions take place?)decentralization scalability: Bitcoin full nodes ﻿can be run﻿ on general consumer hardware and the blocksize limit has been kept low to ensure users with average internet connections can sync and keep up with the blockchain size; there is an increasing selection of node-in-a-box solutions (check the ﻿overview by Bitcoin Magazine﻿)conservative approach to protocol upgrades: softfork activations only, and rigorous peer-review process; even relative “no-brainers” like ﻿Schnorr signatures﻿ take years to implementAll in all, the Bitcoin community has adopted a very conservative and transparent approach towards its protocol development, mostly out of concern of damaging the broad consensus and Bitcoin’s Schelling point attributes. The solid monetary base foundation is the priority—further aggregates can be developed on second or third layers (Lightning, Liquid, ﻿Debnk﻿ etc). Store of value utility arising from a clear and reliable monetary policy seems to be the main driver of global adoption in the past years.This has of course elicited some critique from those that don’t see the point in such conservatism and has lead to various forks (mostly money-grabs like BCH/BSV), new projects (Ethereum) and a good measure of memes.(Above) Meme author ﻿Fiskantes﻿
Parker Lewis from Unchained capital provides a good summary of Bitcoin’s path to moneyness in his “﻿Bitcoin obsoletes all other money﻿”:But remember that scarcity for scarcity sake is not the goal of any money. Instead, the money that provides the greatest constant will facilitate exchange most effectively. The monetary good with the greatest relative scarcity will best preserve value between present and future exchanges over time. Relative price and relative value of all other goods is the information actually desired from the coordination function of money, and in every exchange, each individual is incentivized to maximize present value into the future. Finite scarcity in bitcoin provides the greatest assurance that value exchanged in the present will be preserved into the future, and as more and more individuals collectively identify that bitcoin is the monetary good with the greatest relative scarcity, stability in its price will become an emergent property.Ethereum’s path to moneynessIn contrast to Bitcoin, Ethereum takes an opposing approach to moneyness—that is if we take the DeFi movement as Ethereum’s best and lasting product-market fit. Let’s go through the evidence briefly:focus seems to be mainly on the utility side of moneyness—not SoV or payments as such, but actually using the native token (ETH) as the “﻿economic bandwidth﻿” within the decentralized ecosystemEthereum’s monetary policy is fluid and focused on maximizing chain security (instead of predictable inflation); this is why there is no hard cap and no clear inflation curve for the future—instead, we have a “﻿minimum necessary issuance﻿” social contractHW and bandwidth-heavy nodes—running and syncing full ETH node from scratch is ﻿notoriously hard﻿ and ﻿about 70%﻿ of the nodes are run in hosted cloud services such as AWS; on the other hand, it seems this is being addressed with﻿ dedicated node-in-a-box solutions﻿, in a similar fashion to Bitcoin; also noteworthy is experimentation with economic incentives for node runners (eg. Pocket Network) (RSA note: Eric Wall’s tweet linked above is him syncing and replaying all Ethereum transactions from scratch which is unnecessary imo—using fast sync is practically just as secure and takes 1 day—see details on this)as ﻿David Hoffman explains﻿, there are/will be 3 ways how ETH engineers scarcity: DeFi, staking, and fee burns; this reinforces the thesis that Ethereum’s path to moneyness is an iterative work in progress (2 out of 3 mentioned mechanisms are not in existence yet)in the same article, David Hoffman points out that the concept of money has historically been heavily intertwined with debt (citing Graeber’s Debt: The First 5000 Years), and DeFi protocols bring about precisely this feature to make ETH money—ETH as a standard of deferred paymentEthereum has always operated in a “move fast and break things” fashion, where multiple use cases are tried in parallel and what sticks is then iterated upon. DeFi seems to be a thing that has stuck so far, and various DeFi services have attracted a sustained inflow of ETH as their “economic bandwidth”:Above source: DeFi Pulse
DeFi services are usually praised for their permissionless nature (at least some of them) and composability (the possibility of mutual interaction and synergy).My opinion is that the real game-changers that DeFi services bring to the table are the transparency and auditability. As Ryan Sean Adams points out in the recent discussion in ﻿Ivan on Tech podcast﻿, we cannot audit the collateral and internal operations of Coinbase or Kraken—but we can do that with MakerDAO or Compound. The speed with which the bZx exploit audits came about is a cause for celebration, not for condemnation of the vulnerable protocols. Mt. Gox had been insolvent for 2+ years and no-one knew. bZx got exploited and everybody knew within hours.DeFi as a source of moneyness for ETH has a strong ally on its side: the absurd state of the modern financial system that is anything but open, borderless and inclusive. Even centralized “crypto banks” have to conform: Kraken’s futures trading is ﻿prohibited in 36 countries﻿—including United States, even though Kraken is a US-based company! Moreover, the risk of keeping assets like BTC or ETH with custodians may prove to be an ultimate Achilles’ heel of the monetary revolution—the establishment can simply confiscate the asset, ﻿as happened in the 1930s with gold﻿.On the other hand, DeFi still has a lot of work ahead to truly turn ETH into money.First, there will always be a trade-off between functionality and decentralization. Simple protocols like Uniswap can work as ﻿complete contracts﻿, but is that true for advanced stuff like money markets? With governance and admin keys, there will always be a risk of regulatory action or ﻿governance attack﻿.Second, the composability and protocol interplay bring about both new opportunities and headaches. Nobody saw the flash loans attacks coming. Many more sophisticated attacks are coming as the DeFi space keeps on innovating. The features of transparency and permissionless interaction also introduce a huge honey pot. While insurance protection through Nexus or Opyn may help a bit, the premiums are going to be huge if the attacks happen regularly. So the teams need to be sure they attract exploiters through bounties, not honey pots.Third, DeFi is still a niche and may be a thing of the inner circle of sophisticated Ethereans. There are multiple reasons to think this: Maker, Compound and other services have most of the value locked by a handful of whales; when the ETH price rises, the ETH locked-in-DeFi metric falls (summer 2019 and Feb 2020); the ETH locked-in-DeFi doesn’t grow exponentially over time, as usually happens with startup-like trends—the growth is +3000% for 2018, but only +52% for 2019 and falling so far in 2020. At this point, DeFi has attracted 2.6% of all ETH in circulation. Nice, but still a niche.SummaryBoth Bitcoin and Ethereum have a strong chance to become world’s first digital money without any government involvement. Both have to overcome their potential weaknesses in the coming 5 years:Bitcoin has to survive its hard-coded monetary policy: 2 halvings in the next 5 years will show how that works out. Increasing the “transaction density” through heavy economic activity on sidechains and 2nd layers is critical. Auctioning of future blockspace through futures contracts would help as well (if there is demand for predictable future settlement).Ethereum has to prove it can achieve moneyness on a constantly shifting monetary base. If the shift to Eth2 works out as envisioned, the focus on governance eradication and monetary policy automation should follow. There should be no strong leaders in decentralized money protocol, no matter how charismatic.Both Bitcoin and Ethereum also need to create pockets of circular economies, without a dependence on the fiat on/off-ramps. This is especially true for Bitcoin—in order to establish itself as a future monetary base, its users need to start thinking in bitcoins/satoshis as a natural unit of account.Outside of the scope of this article are various interoperability plays, that might bring joint success of both Ethereum and Bitcoin as money. One of the possible futures is that Bitcoin is the natural monetary base, while Ethereum provides the monetary aggregates and utilizes Bitcoin via trust-minimized pegs like tBTC and renBTC. As we saw in the recent weeks, the future is quite unpredictable and often very wild. Recent developments point to mankind entering a new era, both in global markets and social dynamics. Hopefully there will be a demand for global non-fiat money in this brave new world.Post scriptum: This text was written in large part before the massive Bitcoin and Ethereum sell-off in mid-March 2020. While those events don’t change any of my viewpoints expressed in the article, I concede that current DeFi services (mainly MakerDAO) have shown their fragility, as they are susceptible to failure in the event of a black swan event (namely a failure of the incentivization model in the face of network congestion and market sell-off). However, in this space every failure is also a learning opportunity and if the current class of DeFi services collapse, better ones will stand on top of their shoulders.Author bioJosef Tětek is an analyst at TopMonks—a software development house and startup incubator.

In the darkest moments, amidst market turbulences, you might have found yourself asking if and when Ethereum is going to become a core piece of financial infrastructure. We humans are impatient and sometimes fail at recognizing that ambitious projects take time.Bill Gates said it best…To make sense of the present, I like to look at the past. Recently, I read David Stearn’s book ‘Electronic Value Exchange’ and I was mind blown by the amount of parallels between the early days of Visa and crypto today.What is Visa?Before we look at those parallels, we first must understand what Visa is. Many readers may be surprised to learn that Visa itself does not actually issue cards. Visa is not a bank, nor is it a public utility or a governmental institution.

Dee Hock, the founding father of Visa knew he had to first get people accustomed to electronic payments before they would trust this new method to exchange value over banknotes and paper checks. That’s why Dee made advertising a personal mission.

In crypto, every investor is a stakeholder and memes like “ETH is money” or “Money Legos” emerge organically as they are created by the community.
#2 Airdrops! 💸Visa knew that every payment system relies on network effects to become successful. In Visa’s case, that meant growing a merchant base that would accept Visa cards as well as getting credit cards in the hands of users.To bootstrap a user base, Visa member banks literally airdropped cards to people's homes and gave them a line of credit without asking any questions. Once users started using these cards, banks learned more on their clients purchasing behaviour and were able to adjust credit lines.This practice was later made illegal by the US congress. Not only was it controversial at the time to incentivize people to take on debt, the practice was also incredibly insecure as cards were regularly stolen out of mailboxes. Since users didn’t even realize they had been issued a card, the fraud would often only be discovered a month later when they received their first card statement by mail.Does this remind you of all the phishing schemes in the crypto space and how negatively crypto is often portrayed by the press?#3 Bad UX 😢We often talk about bad UX in crypto but it pales against the UX of card payments in the 1970's.Let’s go through a typical transaction to see how that’s true. Let’s say you’re the holder of a ‘Visa’ card (called BankAmericard at the time) and want to pay for a TV. Since the transaction amount would have been above the merchant’s floor limit (typically $50 but sometimes higher for airlines and hotels), the merchant had to call their bank (acquirer) and verbally convey the transaction details to get a transaction authorized.Next, the acquirer would call the issuing bank of the customer, which would manually check:if the card was not on a 'black list'the user's current balance, credit limit and purchase historyIf everything was in order, the issuer would return an authorization code to the acquirer and the acquirer would give this authorization code to the merchant who was waiting on the line during this entire process. The merchant would then get the customers signature and write it on a 'sales draft' along with the authorization code.The entire process took 15 minutes on average. Don't ask me why anyone voluntarily chose this payment method.For the customer, the story ended here but for the banks it continued as the payment was only cleared not settled.Post-sale, merchants had to send their sales draft to their acquiring bank by mail who had to sort all the incoming drafts manually to chase the payment up with the issuing bank. Finally, the issuing bank would settle the payment through the normal check clearing system.The process was incredibly prone to error and unsurprisingly, there were always disputes between the banks.It took a lot of technological innovation and experimentation (there were competing payment networks') to get the payment experience right. Point-of-sale devices, the magnetic stripe and high-speed communication networks between the authorization centers all eventually helped replacing human authorizers with automated computerized logic but it didn’t happen overnight.And you thought sending a transaction using MetaMask was hard!
#4 The Revolution 🏴The creation of Visa was accompanied by a similar feeling of transformation than many have in crypto today. In fact, Dee Hock would certainly be a crypto fan today.A quote from Dee:If electronic technology continued to advance, and that seemed certain, two-hundred year old banking oligopolies controlling the custody, loan, and exchange of money would be irrecoverably shattered.Another:""Nation-state monopolies on the issue and control of currency would erode…The vast preponderance of the system would fall to those who were most adept at handling and guaranteeing alphanumeric value data in the form of arranged particles of energy.”Last one:“Inherent in all this might be the genesis of a new form of global currency.”Hock had been slowly coming to the realization that “money” had become nothing more than “guaranteed alphanumeric data” and that the traditional competences of banks would start to matter less and less in the decades ahead.No better way to guarantee alphanumeric value data than on a Blockchain no?#5 - Credibly neutral 🏳️Dee knew that in order for banks to join, the network had to be credibly neutral. Afterall, the member banks were competitors at heart. That's why Visa was formed as a jointly-owned organization (no stocks, dividends) and all accumulated net revenue was used to finance the ongoing work of the operation.It was crucial to create an organizational structure that would balance out incentives and assure that even small banks had a say in decision making. Thus, at core, the Visa network consists of operating regulations. A series of rules and regulations that govern everything from the physical design of the card, to the fees each party must pay and the rights and responsibilities each party has during a transaction dispute. These rules along with Visa's role as a sort of judiciary, created the necessary trust between the members that was fundamental for the system to function and grow.Blockchain's have these operating principles baked into the protocol and remove the need for mediation in disputes. Moreover, they significantly loosen the requirements for participation. Issuance and settlement must occur according to the credibly neutral rules of the a blockchain protocol—they rules are executed by code and maintained by the social consensus of users.Interestingly, Hock later said that he always wanted to include participating merchants and even cardholders as full owners in the Visa organization, but the idea was always strongly resisted by the licensee banks.Final ThoughtIf Visa is an enabling organization, then crypto is an enabling platform and there are important differences.In Ethereum’s case, an organization to rule over the network is no longer necessary as blockchains provide economic finality and transactions are not subject to disputes. Furthermore, actors can not only cooperate, Ethereum’s composability means that developers can plug into any existing application to build services that they alone couldn’t provide. Instead of just moving fiat currencies, the Ethereum network moves all sorts of financial assets from fiat currencies to securities and digital collectibles.Lastly, participation in Ethereum is open to anyone and encompasses individuals just as much as organizations. In other words, crypto networks like Ethereum are the logical next step of the evolution of a value exchange network.But for all these differences, both early Visa and current crypto have strong parallels. Money memes, airdrops, UX issues, a revolution, and credibly neutrality were important to Visa in the 1970s and are important to crypto today.How we exchange value is about to change.

It’s completely transparent and anyone can verify how their legislators are voting.Now, with the ability to delegate power in a few clicks across any corner of the world, we no longer compete as nations, but rather as one borderless ecosystem.What exactly is a Protocol Politician?Protocol politicians are someone (or a group of people) who:Oversees governance across specific protocols they are well versed inParticipates in governance regularly to instigate positive change through new proposalsIs willing to publicly vote on controversial issues and back up their votes with rational argumentsThis last point in particular is worth expanding on. Just as we’re seeing with Dharma playing a huge role in Compound’s governance, it’s likely that these systems will be driven by the key players of these protocols.What’s in it for the politicians?Influence has value. And people are willing to pay for it too, especially as protocols facilitate more and more capital flowing through them. Drawing a parallel to today’s politics, U.S. congressional campaigns are raising cash in record numbers. Candidates for the House of Representatives collectively raised ~$1.2 billion in January 2017, over $200M more than the inflation-adjusted ~$1 billion set in the 2010 election cycle.(Above) Number of seats in the house of representatives
Equally as important, there’s only a limited number of seats at the table. With the 3.7M COMP in circulation, there’s only room for ~37 possible delegates (100,000 COMP per delegate). Fully diluted and there’s an absolute max of 100 Compound delegates able to propose changes to the protocol. Eventually, individuals and companies will start to bid for those spots.While it’s still early, we suspect that the capacity for protocol politicians to earn fees will create enticing revenue streams too. Best highlighted by the KyberDAO and the ability for Pool Master (aka protocol politicians) to earn a portion of delegated rewards, we expect there to be individuals and companies that are able to generate sustainable revenues entirely from governance.As it stands today, Kyber is projected to earn $3.4M in annualized revenue. The upcoming Katalyst upgrade is set to allocate 65% of the protocol’s revenue towards governance incentives, or $2.21M up for grabs for participants. What’s interesting with Kyber is that the governance rewards will be in ETH. Delegates will be able to earn a cut of those rewards with whatever fee structure they set while delegators will be able to opt-in and out at any time. We can imagine that as Kyber continues to grow (as it has), the prospective earnings for protocol politicians will only become more lucrative.Compound is another example. At today’s COMP valuations, the lending protocol is currently sitting on a ~$166M treasury allocated entirely for governance incentives. Even if it drips slowly over the next decade at ~$16.6M per year, it is still a massive treasury—even at today’s prices.As we’re seeing with Dharma’s active participation in Compound today, teams may even start allocating resources to specifically focus on governance for protocols they’re invested in.Whether this stems from upgrades that best suit their product or simply having an informed voice over how the protocol evolves, with great composability comes great responsibility. It’s important that people get things right.We can also consider what a protocol politician looks like without financial incentives in mind. While almost 99% of protocol politicians will be motivated to increase the value of underlying holdings or from fees given to them for participating, we can envision a governance “Ghandi” which holds zero tokens, extracts zero rent, but has tons of voting weight. The politician is simply there for the greater good and long-term growth of the underlying protocol.As more protocols tokenize their governance, those who were involved early are likely to be rewarded for doing so. Better yet, value-added work can be recognized in a number of ways, meaning even those without crazy sums of capital can earn governance influence.With Maker, Aave, Kyber, Nexus Mutual, UMA, bZx, and others all set to roll out updated governance frameworks, the time to delegate is now.What’s in it for a delegator?With so many governance discussions happening on a regular basis, it’s important to ensure your voting power is being used on every proposal. Rather than having to do a deep dive to vote one way or another, trusted protocol politicians can play this role for you.We expect protocol politicians to offer services in return for your delegation, including synthesized recaps to keep you informed on key changes without having to be super deep in the weeds on how they got there.We may even see what James Waugh refers to as Proposal Farmers—that is, protocol politicians competing to build the most impactful and widely accepted governance proposals. These proposals may directly be linked to token incentives (which protocol politicians could share with their delegators) in addition to acting as a signal for delegation.(Above) Proposal Farming
Most importantly, delegating to a good protocol politician may be quite lucrative. Outside of the proper protocol upgrades benefitting you as a tokeholder, there may be residual benefits as well—just as we’re seeing with Kyber’s Community Poll and the ability to earn ETH rewards with minimal work or knowledge.Leading Protocol Politicians TodaySo far we’ve seen the usual suspects stepping up to take advantage of being an early protocol politician. While we’ve yet to see delegation really take off, we fully suspect teams to allocate significant marketing resources to aggregate as much voting weight as possible, especially as the revenue opportunities become more attractive.In particular, some emerging protocol politicians include:Media: DeFi Rate and Bankless (👈RSA—we have big plans here!)Consultants: GauntletApplications: Dharma, PoolTogether, and InstaDappThought Leaders: Kain Warwick and Ric BurtonVenture Funds: a16z, Polychain, and IDEO CoLab,Keep a close eye on these guys as we expect them to make some big pushes towards governance incentives in the coming year.A Distributed FutureLet’s imagine these ideas all pan out. What we could very well be looking at are self-sustaining protocols owned and operated by their community. Rather than all the value being accrued to a very small number of people, it is shared pro-rata across all ecosystem actors.And there’s a lot to be gained for those who elect to dive deep into protocols and build up specialized knowledge. Potentially billions.There will eventually be a demand for well-thought, well-communicated, individuals that are qualified for protocol governance. A demand for those that can lead these DeFi protocols to proliferate into open financial infrastructure that will eventually support the billions, if not trillions, in capital.If one thing's for certain, we need the tools to help us get there. From governance aggregation to chat-based voting and delegation, we need to make it easy for the average individual to not only allocate their voting power, but to see how their voting power is being used.More importantly, we need to show that governance matters. Whether it be implementing new features to grow the protocol, updating value accrual mechanisms, or banding together to fight against centralized players with 10x more capital, the story of yield farming needs to emphasize what distributed governance enables.Until then, make sure to do your own honest work.

New members will receive an email on the first day of the month after they subscribe with a link to the mint details. See badge claim instructions Dear Bankless Nation, Our community of crypto spartans continues to level up. A week ago the bZx protocol team approached us. They’re launching a token model to grow their protocol. They need governors. They need distribution. They need community. bZx sent Bankless token holders a proposal for a new, juicy community drop. The Bankless badge holders took it to vote. The question—should badge holders proceed with the BZRX governance proposal? The discussion While bZx has had a difficult past the feedback was enthusiastic: In the words of one badge holder: I really like how [bZx] handled that situation. They also seem to be on the 'cutting edge' of newer ideas in the space. Their new tokenomics with Balancer integration seems interesting. A main concern from badge holders was that the offer was too low for the value the community provides and that the vesting requirements were too high. One holder said: This is a great start but $100 vested over 4 years for 50% voting weight is a bit harsh tbh. Feel like we could get a better deal Another responded: I voted 'yes' as I think it's important to take a first step down the path we want to go. And another: I would vote yes and I am happy with the proposal as it is. I believe in building credit as value is proven out. We may all be high stake risk seekers. Or we may all be well educated visionary’s. The point is, I’m all for a ‘little’ humility up front and demanding bigger stakes as we prove where our value and values, reside. The results Ultimately the result was 96% in favor vs 2% opposed. It seems the Bankless community is overwhelmingly supportive of moving forward with this first community drop!

e11a5eaf4e0df32275466374e2bb613baa3077202351750c7a25ecd03db74dd5,Are Fair Launches Fair?,Market Monday for the week of August 31st!,,"Dear Bankless Nation, As the price of $YFI broke through all barriers this last weekend, all eyes are on DeFi. The common-denominating theme since the launch of yield farming and liquidity mining is this: fair launches. In the world of Ethereum, there has been a long-standing assumption that rent-seeking protocol fees will generally trend towards 0, or at least as low as possible because any protocol that introduces a fee also introduces the incentive to fork it, and offer the same product/service but without the fee. It was believed that protocols or teams could only implement a fee that would be so long as to keep the threat of forking the protocol to a minimum. Swap out ‘fee’ with ‘early VC investment’, and you get the current state of DeFi. It seems that all the money-legos that have been produced over the last 2-3 years have given the grassroots community the tools they need to replicate every single DeFi app on Ethereum, and re-launch it with a new set of protocol owners. Now, for every VC-backed protocol with a high percentage of tokens held by teams and investors, there is an opportunity to fork the code, introduce some yield-farming incentives, and redeploy the same product/service under new management. The incentives for this are so dumbfoundingly simple, that it’s a pretty safe bet to expect that every single DeFi app will have a ‘fair-launch’ carbon-copy spin-off. Frankly, this incentive comes from the same energy as a lot of the ICO’s of 2017: teams that fork the protocol have privileged knowledge and early access to the upside. However, at the same time, the incentives are totally different, because forking-teams have no ability to take an undue percentage of the tokens or print themselves any money. Same pattern, new structure, a big step in the right direction.","Dear Bankless Nation,As the price of $YFI broke through all barriers this last weekend, all eyes are on DeFi.The common-denominating theme since the launch of yield farming and liquidity mining is this: fair launches.In the world of Ethereum, there has been a long-standing assumption that rent-seeking protocol fees will generally trend towards 0, or at least as low as possible because any protocol that introduces a fee also introduces the incentive to fork it, and offer the same product/service but without the fee.It was believed that protocols or teams could only implement a fee that would be so long as to keep the threat of forking the protocol to a minimum.Swap out ‘fee’ with ‘early VC investment’, and you get the current state of DeFi.

James Prestwich echoed his point…the average position size is $117k. This isn’t retail, these are whales. Same as the old boss.Jacob and James are missing something. We’ve just invented a new way to allow retail to gain the same level of access as VCs! Joey Krug of Pantera confirmed the point. His fund wasn’t structured for farm YFI, so they had to buy it.Laws of the UniverseIt’s important to remind ourselves: some laws are written into the fabric of the universe itself, and will never be able to be violated.Capital begets capitalPeople paid to make money will outperform people not paid to make moneyProfessionals and professional teams have more resources to make more informed decisions than retail amateursOne thing that’s also written into the fabric of the Universe is that humanity tends to create new systems of fairness that get permanently integrated into the world.The world always trends toward more fairness and more equality. This thesis is a core component of A Bankless Nation pt. 1and in A Bankless Nation pt. 2where I discuss how all protocols will eventually converge on their least-extortionary version.The way humans organize themselves across time becomes fairer and fairer.No, with this new wave of fair launches and liquidity mining, we haven’t relegated VC behind Retail. Rather, instead, we’ve given Retail the tools and opportunities to become VCs!Venture Capital will never go away; there always exists the possibility of front-running the opportunity, and there’s also the possibility of paying someone else to do that for you. That’s VC.Fair launches on Ethereum don’t care if it is Venture Capital or Retail that is competing for the yield; if there was an attempt to restrict VC involvement, it wouldn’t be a fair launch anymore ¯\_(ツ)_/¯Let me reiterative, if you’ve participated in a fair launch, either with $10 or $10M, this is you:With Ethereum, not only can you be your own bank, but you can be your own VC.That’s game-changing.- David HoffmanP.S.

Register with “BANKLESS” to get 25$ off.","Dear Bankless Nation,On September 28th, Jake Chervinsky, General Counsel to Compound Labs, reminded us that the SEC and CFTC end their fiscal years on September 30th.This is the last window where performance reports and budget requests are made by these agencies, so Jake hypothesized that some interesting news will be coming, as the SEC and CFTC attempt to beat the buzzer with their work.There is precedent for this. Last year, the news of the landmark EOS settlement was released on September 30th. September 28th was the 8-year anniversary of the Ross Ulbricht case, which sentenced the operator of the Bitcoin-powered Silk Road Tor-based marketplace to life in prison.The SEC and CFTC did not disappoint on Jake’s prediction. Four things last week:SEC ordered Salt Lending to return the $47M raised from the SALT ICO back to investors, $250,000 civil penalty 😬Kik lost its case against the SDNY, trying to defend its $100M 2017 ICO; Kik must develop a plan to return investors funds. 😯The CFTC charged BTC derivatives exchange BitMEX with operating an illegal derivatives platform (and allowing US citizens) 😮The Southern District of NY charged Founders/Executives of BitMEX with violating the Bank Secrecy Act (SERIOUS CHARGE, Federal Prison??) 😱Seems apparent that the end of September is when we can expect U.S. regulators to draw the line on how far the world of crypto, digital assets, and permissionless blockchains can push the boundaries.Once-a-year, the SEC and CFTC claim parts of the crypto world have gone “too far”, and makes strategic moves to remind us that the reach of the United States’ authority knows no bounds. If there is a central location for these agencies to create pressure, it will be done.(Above) Excerpt from United States District Court USA vs Arthur Hayes et. al Sealed Indictment
The crypto-world is divided on the BitMEX charges1⃣ Bitcoiners see this as an attack on Bitcoin, another instance of the nation state ensuring the primacy of the Dollar as the fundamental financial tool of the world. BitMEX is famously a Bitcoin-centric asset exchange. No ERC20 tokens, no crypto-dollars or on-ramps—JUST Bitcoin. This was likely a purposeful choice to reduce legal exposure, but it doesn’t seem to have stopped the protectors of the U.S. dollar empire from going after BitMEX, Bitcoiners’ beloved Bitcoin-bank.2⃣ Others are taking a ‘good riddance’ attitude to BitMEX, as a shady off-shore exchange that almost certainly traded against their customers and extorted their BTC. This perspective is loudly coming out of the DeFi camp, who are using this as a fantastic example of why a DeFi version of BitMEX would be better:If truly decentralized, then there’s no one to charge with violationsProtocols are credible neutrality, and can’t trade against their customersNo longer just going after low hanging fruitThe SEC actions against the Kik and Salt ICOs are also interesting. Notably, neither of these ICOs were claimed to be fraudulent, malicious, or harmful to investors. The only motivation here is the lack of proper securities filings and improper sales. This is something different than the Munchie or Paragon ICOs, which were widely regarded as scams among the crypto community. The precedent is being set by these actions as the SEC is starting to go after fruit further up the tree.What do these actions mean for DeFi?The implications of these actions are interesting for DeFi. While we generally assume many DeFi apps to be immune from three-letter-agencies, this belief is yet untested. Uniswap, for example, has employees and a hierarchy of leadership.

cd4571d0b1b93049f2db800f098346cb392dc12a7cd9deef077555990d96cfc5,Are We Trustless Yet?,Examining the importance of trustless finance with last night's Harvest Finance exploit,,"Dear Bankless Nation, I recently had a Twitter conversation with Bankless citizen Above Average Joe about the definition of ‘trustless’. But what ‘trustless’ means is actually difficult to pin down. Because making something ‘trustless’ is difficult in the first place. There are virtually endless attack vectors that could potentially reduce the trustlessness of a smart contract on Ethereum. This is what we narrowed in on: The lack of required belief that another party will behave in the the manner specified beforehand. I like AAJ’s definition because it emphasizes the intent of a protocol . Code is deployed on Ethereum with a specific purpose in mind. Sometimes code on Ethereum can do things that are separate from its intended purpose. And the by-product  of this are almost always things that go against the explicit goals of the code. As we know, the DAO ‘hack’ wasn’t a true hack. Nothing on Ethereum can be ‘hacked’ because there’s no way to use code on Ethereum in an ‘unauthorized’ manner. Either you can do it because the code allows for it, or you can’t because the code doesn’t allow for it. The DAO hack was an ‘unintended exploit’, which is appending a subjective rationale for how the DAO should have been used, versus how it was actually used. I responded to Joe: If we want a trustless economy in DeFi to exist, all subjectivity needs to be removed from the execution of code. If you, as a user, are making assumptions that the code will behave as intended, then it is not trustless. There are no assumptions in trustless code. A key component of a trustless economy is that we’re able to use smart contracts to remove assumptions about the intentions of other actors in the system. If using a smart contract requires assumptions of good faith from other actors in the system, then the system is not trustless. John Adler really gets to the heart of the issue with his definition of ‘trustless’ with two rules: So it boils down to this: You can always access your money No one else can access your money Simple as that! Using this framework for evaluating DeFi applications, the level of ‘trustlessness’ in the system extends far beyond ‘admin key risk’. Admin key risk is the risk that the original deployers of a contract hold the admin keys to the contract, and thus aren’t trustless because it fails John Adlers rule #2: no one else can access your money. Composability is the main reason why DeFi is so powerful, however it also means that simply removing admin keys does not mean that we have solved the second rule. In other words, composability makes solving rule #2 much harder than simply removing admin keys—it adds a ton of new possible attack vectors that requires further hardening of a protocol in order to minimize user assumptions.","Dear Bankless Nation,I recently had a Twitter conversation with Bankless citizen Above Average Joe about the definition of ‘trustless’.But what ‘trustless’ means is actually difficult to pin down.Because making something ‘trustless’ is difficult in the first place.

The attacker then flushed these funds through RenBTC to wash the stolen funds.Once again, we are now seeing this same conversation play out with the Farm exploit that occurred last night. But now, we can move though the regular BS of was it a hack? or an exploit? or arbitrage? and skip straight to it doesn’t matter, it wasn’t used as intended.Scott Lewis of DeFi Pulse labels this as ‘a crime’.While I agree with Scott here, I also want to de-emphasize the importance of it being ‘a crime’.Courts and laws are for the world of subjectivity. Ethereum and smart contracts are for the world of objectivity.According to Ethereum, code is law. Therefore, all protocols need operate under this assumption. If we want a trustless financial system to come to fruition, the only assumption that can be made is that openly-verifiable code is law, and that your protocol isn’t going to be protected by the social layer of the world.No one is coming to save your contracts from exploits, so you better remove all possible trust assumptions before someone exploits all your value.DeFi isn’t taking over the world until all assumptions have been removed.Once this happens, then DeFi is truly unstoppable 🚀-David",https://www.bankless.com/are-we-trustless-yet-market-monday,2020-10-26T00:00:00.000Z,"https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/image/fetch/w_1200,h_600,c_limit,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https-3a-2f-2fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com-2fpublic-2fimages-2fa962d393-f053-4c71-a342-c915ebf8e939_1894x1134.jpg",David Hoffman,Bankless,blog,,Unknown Error

We see this in many instances, from the eruption of bitcoin champion Michael Saylor onto the media stage, to the monumental shifts we’ve seen lately from Ray Dalio. Ray went from this on November 17th: To this on December 9th: The most bullish thing for Bitcoin is being understood, because the rest of the story writes itself. Ethereum fights this same battle. But it’s a harder fight for ETH. Like blocks propagating through the internet, knowledge spreads better in smaller packets. And Ethereum is harder to fold into a small bundle of information. Nevertheless, Ethereum is making progress in this uphill battle. Ethereum’s ability to overcome the difficulty of being understood is aided by three factors: Big Brother Bitcoin High Knowledge Surface Area Proximate Models 1. Big Brother Bitcoin Bitcoin is 12 years old and has over a decade of Lindy behind it. It’s fought the slog of boom and bust cycles all alone, and without a real friend. It did the hard work of forcing the conversation of Internet money, and its merits are finally being recognized. Fortunately, this is a battle that only has to be fought once. Once someone’s mind is opened to the possibility of a ‘cryptocurrency’ being legitimate, a world of interesting assets opens up. The crypto space seems tribally divided between Bitcoin, Ethereum, and everything else. But the outside world does not see our industry this way. Once Bitcoin becomes legitimate in the eyes of the people, so does the entire industry. Few people will extend legitimacy to Bitcoin, and not, therefore , cryptocurrency at large. New entrants usually don’t meaningfully separate Bitcoin from the rest of the industry as most Bitcoiners do. I remember my older sister getting mad that my parents gave me a cell phone much sooner in my life—she had to wait longer. That’s what’s happening here. Ethereum is Bitcoin’s younger sibling that automatically receives the benefits of all the effort the older sibling already put into advocating for themselves.","Dear Bankless Nation,The bullish undercurrents that the industry has been feeling lately are caused by a single common denominator: becoming understood.We see this in many instances, from the eruption of bitcoin champion Michael Saylor onto the media stage, to the monumental shifts we’ve seen lately from Ray Dalio.Ray went from this on November 17th:To this on December 9th:The most bullish thing for Bitcoin is being understood, because the rest of the story writes itself.Ethereum fights this same battle.

That’s what’s happening here. Ethereum is Bitcoin’s younger sibling that automatically receives the benefits of all the effort the older sibling already put into advocating for themselves.2. High Knowledge Surface AreaBitcoin’s ability to compress its value proposition is a feature of the simplicity of the network and the asset. However, it sacrifices a component of reach while doing so.What could Ethereum do for you?Payments?Yield?Exchange?Assets?Disintermediation?Open-source financial engineering?Internet collectives?Art and gaming?If you’re not going to be maximally reductive like Bitcoin, you better be maximally expressive like Ethereum. You don’t need to understand every single facet of Ethereum to know that it provides you with something you’re interested in.The ‘Blind Men and an Elephant’ metaphor is often used in crypto. Each blind man feels a part of the elephant and describes what they feel.An elephant is like a snake, says the man feeling the trunk.
It’s like a tree! says the man feeling the leg.
It’s like a rope! says the man feeling the tailAs people are coming to learn what Ethereum is, they have so much more surface area to cover before it is known what it is being discovered. This leaves two points to consider:Pessimistically, this means that it’s harder to understand Ethereum. Optimistically, it means that Ethereum has more optionality with how it chooses to express itself to the rest of the world.3. Proximate Mental ModelsI believe there are a few extremely strong mental models of Ethereum that resonate with the investor-class.I. The Internet BondAfter accepting the concept of Internet-issued money via Bitcoin, the concept of an Internet bond market isn’t far off.Sovereign bond markets are a naturally occurring phenomenon that emerge as aftermarket to sovereign debt. Like the State, Ethereum can never default. Ethereum can issue new ETH in perpetuity. However, like Bitcoin, its issuance is constrained by code and its value is derived from people’s belief in the code to properly manage the money.In a world devoid of yield, where the average interest rates of global bond markets (over $70 trillion market) approach 0%, Ethereum’s ability to guarantee yield under any conditions is a uniquely compelling and understandable value proposition.II. Backed by the Decentralized EconomyEthereum is an economy, and it’s easy to understand this after one sees Ethereum hosting $20B in stablecoins or after an Ethereum exchange starts hosting more volume than Coinbase.Just as the value of a dollar is backed by the U.S. economy, the value of ETH is backed by Ethereum’s decentralized economy. Now, imagine the Ethereum economy growing 10x in size, while the issuance of ETH is constrained by code to be below 1%.These are the mental models that will onboard Ethereum’s own version of a Michael Saylor or a ETH buy for the MassMutual balance sheet. And we’re already seeing this with companies like Ether Capital (podcast next week) and funds like 3iQ.The Second Non-Sovereign AssetThe people who are tribal about BTC vs ETH vs XYZ or who are arguing about which of these are money or not are people who are already inside the industry.The rest of the world has no resistance to increasing the number of non-sovereign SoV assets produce by the cryptocurrency industry from ‘1’ to ‘2’, so long as the arguments are there.I believe that the world is not only capable of understanding how ETH fits into their portfolio, they are hungry for it.The investor class is curious and autodidact. The world has just gone through a year of massive change and shifts. They’re starting to understand Bitcoin.Now they’re about to understand Ethereum.- DavidP.S. We published another Vitalik Speaks!

It certainly wasn’t ideal. But that was back in 2017, and things have changed since then. ( Cryptography fixed this btw ) Even after lowering to 32 ETH, that’s still $40,000. Pretty steep. Staking Pools have been a constant topic in the Ethereum ecosystem for a long time. There will always be smaller holders of ETH, and it is in Ethereum’s values to enable their enfranchisement with Ethereum. I start this article off by talking about my thesis behind Decentralized Staking-as-a-Service (DSaaS) protocols; what they can do for us, why we need them, and how they should be built. DSaaS protocols uphold and extends the values of Ethereum, and generally makes it a stronger system. I then bring up Rocket Pool, an OG Ethereum project that has been following and working alongside Ethereum PoS development since 2017. I explain my reasoning and my thought process using a number of the theses and concepts discussed on the Bankless program like the Protocol Sink, money legos, and monetary competition. While I offer a model for understanding and appreciating the potential that DSaaS bring to Ethereum, Rocket Pool will either succeed or fail as a result of the choices of the RPL-owning community. Like all token governance systems, there will be decisions that need to be made, and there are both good and bad moves. In order to evaluate RPL, it is not enough to just understand the protocol, but you must also understand the community behind the system. - David THURSDAY THOUGHT Bankless Writer: David Hoffman, Bankless Founding Father Decentralized Staking Protocols: Extending Ethereum’s Core Values Ethereum was designed with a certain set of guiding principles that can be distilled down to a single objective:","Dear Bankless Nation,Here’s a piece of Ethereum trivia: before it was 32 ETH to stake to Ethereum 2.0, it used to be 1,500.

Cutting the corners on the path to producing a scalable, proof-of-stake blockchain would mean the disenfranchisement of many potential ecosystem participants.When the design goals of Ethereum are to be able to host all of global economic activity, the six years of labor spent by the Ethereum 2.0 developers is a small sacrifice for increasing Ethereum’s inclusivity for generations to come.We have already seen entire ecosystems come and go as a result of cutting-of-corners.EOS created a high-throughput, low-cost, proof-of-stake blockchain. But it cut corners on scale by restricting blockchain consensus to 21 super-computers and using ‘Delegated Proof of Stake’, which created the ability to focus the direction of EOS token seigniorage, but not the ability to distribute EOS tokens to any and everyone, all at once.A scaled, proof-of-stake blockchain, but only 21 entities can participate in consensus, and therefore only 21 entities can access EOS rewards. All other ecosystem participants are secondary citizens subject to EOS inflation because EOS cut-corners in its design.The entire effort around Ethereum 2.0 was to create a financial system in which economic security can be assured at the protocol level, and the funding that pays for security is made accessible to anyone that wants to have access to it.The Seignorage ProblemThe Seignorage Problem: The entity with seignorage rights must secure itself from attackers, or else they may steal the seignorage rights for themselves.The seignorage problem has plagued money ever since we invented it. Every money has a genesis story or event, and inside the genesis of money, there’s historically been an entity that has the power to make more of it.Bitcoin solves the seigniorage problem by deleting it (🤞), making BTC the most scarce asset possible, and incentivizing people to mine for BTC as a result of that scarcity, and thereby making Bitcoin secure.Ethereum solves the seigniorage problem by distributing new issuance to everyone. Because of this fairness and inclusivity of allowing anyone to access issuance, it becomes the Schelling point of currency legitimacy.Ethereum 2.0 will offer the ability for the average individual to stake ETH on consumer level hardware, on laptops or Raspberry Pi’s, and participate in Ethereum security and receive ETH issuance. The BLS signature scheme that was incorporated into ETH 2 allows for unlimited numbers of participants from joining into the protocol and offering their security to the network.So long as you have 32 ETH, you can participate in ETH staking.Ah shit, wait….32 ETH is $45,000 as of January 26th, 2021.Damn, that’s pretty expensive. Most people don’t have $45,000 in cash, and fewer are able to stomach trading $45,000 US dollars to 32 ETH where the future value is unknown.The US dollar price of 32 ETH is already prohibitively expensive for 98% of the world’s population, and right now the price of ETH is going up and to the right pretty damn fast. As a result, it would be a shame if Ethereum consensus participation was only restricted to ETH whales and early adopters who made a high conviction bet on the future of crypto networks.More importantly, it would go against the first point of this essay: Ethereum’s dictate is maximizing inclusivity.If only we had a way to democratize access to Eth2 staking. Perhaps a way for users to pool their ETH together and give it to someone who’s capable of running the hardware. In turn, anyone with any ETH amount could participate in Ethereum consensus and access ETH issuance.Then, Ethereum’s commitment to maximizing inclusivity would be upheld.Well, it turns out Ethereum's application layer can offer solutions to its own problems.Decentralized Staking-as-a-ServiceEthereum has an app for that.The long-term bull case for Ethereum is that it can produce a decentralized alternative for virtually anything.Decentralized Staking-as-a-Service (DSaaS) aims to decentralize any intermediates that may arise between ETH and Ethereum, and provide a more inclusive platform to democratize access to the Ethereum protocol.As with many Ethereum applications, DSaaS has the opportunity to successfully offer a decentralized alternative to centralized staking-as-a-service providers, but it also comes with significant positive ‘n-order consequences’ (second-order effects)Here’s the 6 things DSaaS Protocols can do:1. Break up Ethereum 2.0 Staking into its component partsWhat necessary components do you have to offer the protocol? ETH? A node? If you only have one of these things, you can combine your components with the components of others who have the things that you lack.Have 32+ ETH, but no hardware?Do you have the hardware, but no ETH?Or maybe not enough ETH?These components can all be mixed together into the same pool, and coordinated by DSaaS to produce a functioning decentralized Ethereum Proof of Stake network.Additionally, the combination of people with nodes and people with ETH unlocks access to a third party of people: Staked ETH holders.2. Provide Staked-ETH TokensEvery Staking-as-a-Service protocol will issue Staked ETH derivative tokens. These will represent claims upon the ETH deposits, plus the interest earned by the system. These ‘S-ETH’ tokens will act as money in Ethereum. They offer the same attributes of T-bills based of the claims that the tokens offer on the underlying ETH.These staked ETH tokens will be the buildable surface area that these providers will offer to Ethereum. Applications like MakerDAO, Uniswap, Compound, Aave will all likely accept these assets to be collateral.3. Protect Deposits, Earn InterestWith a DSaaS protocol, user deposits must be protected above all else.This is about putting strength into the S-ETH as a monetary asset. In the same way MakerDAO makes DAI a viable stablecoin by keeping it strongly backed and strongly pegged, a good DSaaS protocol will make its own S-ETH, which will be backed by ETH, uptime, and perhaps a native token as a collateral of last resort.ETH staking—like everything in Ethereum—is a game. Validators are competing in uptime to receive more ETH than their counterparts. Validators that compound their ETH faster than their counterparts are able to compound their ETH faster, and ‘get ahead’. Thankfully, this is an extremely slow process. Yet the incentive to maintain uptime is met with ease in achieving uptime, thanks to the efforts behind Ethereum 2.0.DSaaS can offer stronger incentives to maintain higher uptimes than the typical solo ETH Staker would be incented to achieve. As a result, S-ETH becomes a competitive monetary asset in the world of interest-bearing ETH notes.4. Incentivize node operators to outperformEthereum offers a platform to tinker with incentives.DSaaS protocols enable the incentive management of Ethereum node operators, with a goal to produce a system in which node operators are economically motivated to provide high quality node operating services to the protocol.This is the economics part of crypto-economics.5. Ensure staking infrastructure and components are as decentralized as possible, in keeping with Ethereum’s philosophy and security.This is the ethos component. Some people, myself included, believe that there are strong philosophical and ethical arguments for why Ethereum is good, and that Ethereum is only good because of the good virtues that it upholds. Accessibility, permisionlessness, censorship resistance, credible neutrality—together they create an un-manipulatable landscape of money and finance.These are the things that are at stake with Ethereum. DSaaS can help the world steward the values that Ethereum bring to the world.6. Provide a scalable staking network capable of handling all demand for DSaaS service providersThis is the cool component.A good DSaaS protocol must be able to absorb the potential maximum number of people who wish to use the platform to partake in Ethereum consensus.Ethereum is a wholesaler. It operates in lot sizes of 32 ETH and bring-your-own-node. Rocket Pool is the distributor. It can operate in any size of ETH, and any size of node.The ‘Last Mile’ describes the last leg of a journey comprising the movement of people and goods from a transportation hub to a final destination""Last mile"" was adopted from the telecommunications industry which faced difficulty connecting individual homes to the main telecommunications network. Similarly, in supply chain management last-mile describes the difficult last part in the transportation of people and packages from hubs to final destinations. 

Last-mile delivery is an increasingly studied field as the number of business to consumer (b2c) deliveries grow especially from e-commerce companies in freight transportation, and ride-sharing companies in personal transportation. Some challenges of last-mile delivery include minimizing cost, ensuring transparency, increasing efficiency, and improving infrastructure.

Wikipedia.A DSaaS protocol is trying to solve the Last Mile problem of distributing consensus participation. To whatever degree that Ethereum 2.0 can decentralize consensus, DSaaS can take it further.For Ethereum to eat the digital world, it needs a system for coordinating mass amounts of node infrastructure and ETH to come together.The scaling of Ethereum consensus revolves around the ability to maximize the pairing between ETH and Node.✍️ Writer’s NoteScalable is a word that is used different across many different ecosystems. Bitcoiners use ‘scalable’ to illustrate the ability to which society is able to use BTC as an anchor. Bitcoin is ‘socially scalable’ as public money infrastructure.‘Scale’ is often used by ‘Ethereum killers’, in a skeuomorphic attempt to solve the congestion and data throughput problems that public blockchains offer.Ryan illustrates scale as ‘trustless economic bandwidth’; the market-cap of ETH is bandwidth for trustless economic activity.Rocket PoolRocket Pool is an attempt from Ethereum’s app layer to produce a DSaaS Provider that can operate at the bottom of the Protocol Sink.Similar to the laborious effort behind Ethereum 2.0, Rocket Pool has been committed to maximizing and extending the values and ethos behind Ethereum’s consensus mechanism.It’s extremely important that we have a DSaaS provider that resonates with Ethereum in design and ethos. If this option isn’t available to us, Ethereum consensus would be restricted to a smaller set of inidividuals, and those that are disenfranchized would be related to centralized SaaS providers.If centralized SaaS come to dominate Ethereum consensus, that could spell trouble. It’s common belief that all SaaS (Centralized or Decentralized) will all issue a S-ETH derivative token, and they will all compete for liquidity in Ethereum.This could be the 'DETH of Ethereum’. Liquidity begets liquidity, and when it comes to S-ETH (or DETH), that compounding effect means that a centralized entity comes to hold more and more ETH. If the S-ETH derivative token issued by a centralized SaaS provider comes to be the dominant form of yield-bearing ETH, this would mean that the centralized entity would slowly march its way into a dominate position in Ethereum consensus.In the way that DAI offers us a trustless alternative to USDC and USDT, rETH (Rocket Pool’s S-ETH token) can offer us a similar safe-haven for trustless Staked ETH.rETH is MoneyWhen you come to Rocket Pool and stake your ETH, you will receive rETH in return. This is your ticket-stub. Your claim on the underlying. You can take that ticket and spend it like money, because if the commitments assured by Rocket Pool hold up, it’s as good as money.U.S. treasuries are considered ‘cash-like’ instruments, and thus something like rETH would fit that same comparison as it relates to ETH.It’s important that rETH becomes competitive as a money.And I think it will, as rETH has certain features that gives it stronger assurances than any centralized S-ETH token could ever offer. I define ‘trustlessness’ as ‘the assurances that one has that their money will behave in ways they expect and intend’. If a protocol is trustless, it means that you have complete assurances that you are uncompromised in your control over money and assets.Rocket Pool is a math-driven protocol, meant to serve any and all requests no matter way. Coinbase is a trust-driven company, which will never be able to offer stronger assurances than what is offered by decentralized applications on Ethereum like Uniswap or Rocket Pool.Money itself is an asset with assurances. Good monies offer assurances to their salability and access, and rETH offers the strongest possible assurances with ETH redeemability. Therefore, rETH will be good money.As these young DSaaS providers like Rocket Pool come into the market, we as users can protect Ethereum by adopting rETH or any other DSaaS S-ETH derivative token that arrives.We’re watching this same battle play out between DAI and USDC/USDT.DAI is Ethereum’s native, trustless, permissionless stablecoin. If Nation States turn authoritarian, USDC and USDT would fall, but DAI would remain. This is because MakerDAO maximizes the use of cryptography, and uses crypto-economics where it can’t. DAI is a crucial tool in the toolbelt to guarantee the trustlessness and permissionlessness of Ethereum, and it is created out of the maximizing what makes this industry so unique.2017 was the beginning of Ethereum’s stablecoin wars, which has generally settled today into DAI, USDC, USDT, and an extremely nascent world of algorithmic stablecoins. This same story is about to play out again, but instead of crypto dollars its going to be staked-ETH derivatives.Last week, Coinbase announced plans to acquire Staking-As-A-Service company Bison Trails. Coinbase already has stake in USDC as well, so this is completely within their core competency.It’s important that Coinbase does not maintain outsized control over DeFi’s crypto-dollar market, and especially not its staked-ETH derivative asset, as that means that an outsized amount of ETH is under the control of Coinbase.The Protocol SinkThe Protocol Sink protects this from happening.Uniswap has quickly risen to become a viable competitor to Coinbase, after topping Coinbase in volumes multiple times in 2020. It is an example of what this space can achieve when it sticks to the values of Ethereum, and is deep in the protocol sink.The landscape of Staking-as-a-Service Providers will feel the pull of the Protocol Sink just like everything else in this universe. We can expect there will be a decentralized version of this centralized service down in the Great Protocol Sink.The most trustless and permissionless, strongest Staked-ETH derivative token will offer the most buildable and stable surface area for applications to integrate, and thus will have persistent demand as the growing DeFi ecosystem accepts the incentives that rETH offer over unproductive ETH.rETH has an intrinsic advantage over Coinbase-ETH. As a protocol, rETH is blessed with tailwinds of credible neutrality. Protocols are more enticing to build upon than companies are. Even Coinbase itself could issue Coinbase-ETH by depositing their customer’s ETH into the Rocket Pool protocol, making ETH the M0, rETH the M1, and Coinbase ETH the M2.According to the Protocol Sink Thesis, neutral protocol tends to attract a wider variety of users, from individuals to large scale companies. Deep protocols offer level playing-fields for everyone; this fairness and neutrality means that something like Rocket Pool can become a public good.Resonance with EthereumRocket Pool is a fantastic example of what is Ethereum’s primary competency: producing open-source coordination software that reduces dependency on trusted intermediaries. It’s also handy, because the success of Rocket Pool positively feeds back into Ethereum itself, and helps integrate it with the world around it.My most recent piece, Ethereum the Tree of Trust, I discussed how applications that have resonance with the values of Ethereum receive favorable treatment from the Ethereum ecosystem. We see this in Uniswap, an Ethereum app that is a reflection of the values that Ethereum is built on. Trustlessness, permissionlessness, credibly-neutral.I see Rocket Pool as an extension of what makes Ethereum, Ethereum. Rocket Pool has followed a committed path to not cutting corners, and I believe this is how you play long term games.Rocket Pool elected to not launch during this initial phase, as they can’t adhere to the decentralized, trustless ethos they’ve committed too. Phase 0 doesn’t support withdrawals to smart contract addresses; meaning that in order to democratize staking in the current environment, ‘decentralized’ staking protocols must utilize a centralized custodian to control validator withdrawal keys.The corners not cut by Rocket Pool will mean the long-term enfranchisement of many more ecosystem participantsWatching the creation of Ethereum is a once in a lifetime, decades-long opportunity, as we set Ethereum’s course for the countless generations ahead of us. Applications that understand this and take on that challenge I expect to be the protocols that last until the very end.Protecting EthereumWhen Ethereum’s beacon chain went live, Bonding Together was released on Bankless. It discussed the relationship between the inclusiveness of Ethereum’s consensus algorithm and its ability to corral a sufficiently large army of people all coordinated with the same goals.It was a call-to-arms to uphold the value we see in Ethereum together. To protect what we see as good for the world. It’s important to stake ETH to Ethereum, or else this would all be for naught.It’s entirely possible that the future of Ethereum is consensus by large exchanges or ETH holding institutions. If centralized bodies are staking too much ETH, it could be the 'DETH of Ethereum’.Rocket Pool is the decentralized, community-driven protocol that offers the counterweight to centralized staking-as-a-service providers. Rocket Pool makes it easy for retail to self-custody and stake without trust, and uphold the values that make Ethereum so great.Gold is a permissionless, non-sovereign, trustless store-of-value asset, which shares many of the qualities that make BTC and ETH so great. Except gold is heavy and difficult to verify, and these frictions made it much more efficient to store gold in vaults than on one’s person. Eventually, over thousands of years, gold has centralized into central banks, and the people of the world have been left with paper instead.I even fear that BTC might succumb to the same fate, because of a reliance on crypto-banks to process Bitcoin transactions, as Bitcoin isn’t sufficiently scalable. It doesn’t have the necessary infrastructure to be able to serve the globe without centralized providers.Under a centralized staking-as-a-service regime, Ethereum could succumb to these same capturing forces! If it is difficult to take part in operations on Ethereum, centralized intermediaries will come to solve that problem. While centralized intermediaries aren’t inherently bad, intermediaries when it comes to network consensus is not where we want them to contribute value.If Ethereum consenus gets captured by centralized intermediaries, then all Ethereum applications and transactions get filtered through these entities.Thankfully, for every centralized intermediary, Ethereum has an app for that.Rocket Pool is staking-as-a-service protocol by the people, for the people.Its growth comes from adoption and stewarding by the masses, and ensures power stays in the hands of the many rather than the few.ETH staking pools are here.Action stepsResearch decentralized staking protocols like Rocket Pool & LidoStake your ETH!",https://www.bankless.com/how-ethereum-can-democratize-eth2,2021-01-28T00:00:00.000Z,"https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/image/fetch/w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https-3a-2f-2fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com-2fpublic-2fimages-2ffe6a7ef7-c805-42f6-8d29-1a9d08e5057a_793x853.jpg",David Hoffman,Bankless,blog,,Unknown Error

Peaster, lead writer of Bankless’s NFT publication Metaversal.How to get exposure to NFTsEveryone in crypto is talking about NFTs lately. But why?They represent the future of digital content. They’re on-chain, programmable, tradable, permissionless, and DIY media legos built for the digital age.These blank digital canvases are game changers for creators of all stripes. But it’s one thing to talk and gawk about them, and it’s another thing to start trying to get direct NFT exposure in your portfolio. So where do you even start?That’s where many people find themselves lately, both crypto novices and veterans alike. There’s no shame to your game no matter what walk of life you come from: everyone’s in the same boat right now trying to grasp NFTs and their potential, from small artists to big institutions.So how does someone start taking up promising positions around the blossoming NFT economy?Well it’s as pertinent a question as ever, seeing as how billionaire investors like Mark Cuban and Chamath Palihapitiya are currently diving head first into NFTs. Do you want to be late to this once-in-a-lifetime cultural party?This tactic will show you how you can build your NFT portfolio through a variety of means, including directly buying NFTs, buying NFT platform tokens, or buying NFT index fund tokens.Of course, make sure to do your own research! This guide is only some ideas on how to get started.Goal: Get NFT exposure in your crypto portfolioSkill: Easy/Intermediate.Effort: 15-30 mins to get started.ROI: Potentially significant if you sit on your NFTs for years as the NFT market continues to go mainstream.How to approach NFTsThere are a range of ways to get exposure to NFTs, including NFT games, so fortunately you’ve got options. Ultimately, it’s up to you to decide which, if any, of these approaches is right for your portfolio.A simple place to start is to just buy NFTs in your price range from projects and creators that you find compelling. You’ll custody these NFTs in the same way you manage your ERC-20 tokens, like through a hardware wallet or a browser wallet like MetaMask.But there are other interesting ways to capitalize on the upside of the NFT ecosystem, too.I’ll break down all your main options here so you can start devising your personal NFT strategy.1. Owning NFTs directlyEthereum already has more than a few general NFT marketplaces like OpenSea and Rarible that aggregate NFTs from around the ecosystem, thereby letting users shop for a wide array of NFTs via singular, user-friendly dashboards.Source: opensea.ioAdditionally, there are also specialized NFT marketplaces like SuperRare and Nifty Gateway (watch our show with them), which are specifically centered around cryptoart NFTs.You can use both of these kinds of platforms, of course, but before you can do anything you’ll need to have some ETH set aside for buying and/or bidding on NFTs.Marketplaces like OpenSea allow purchases and sales in many tokens, but ETH is usually the main currency of choice. You’ll also want to have a browser wallet like MetaMask so you can directly interact with NFT marketplace’s smart contracts.Source: superare.co/discoverOnce you have your crypto money and a wallet ready, it’s time to go shopping. Go to your marketplace of choice and connect your wallet, and you’ll be ready to get to collecting.Have a budget that you work within, and then look for NFTs that fall inside your price range. You might not be able to afford every cool NFT that catches your eye, but there are certainly NFTs available at all prices and from creators of all backgrounds.Of course, there’s not necessarily a right or wrong way to build an NFT collection. Just realize that NFTs are illiquid assets, and you’re not guaranteed to make back the ETH you spend. Remember: value is subjective—it’s all in the eyes of the beholder!There are no shortage of opportunities or market inefficiencies to capitalize on around NFTs right now.However, your safest approach is to just buy NFTs that you personally find really cool or unique and that you wouldn’t mind having for years. The potential upside is that someone else may eventually find your NFT really cool, too, and make a profitable offer on it at some point in the future.⚠️ Pro-tip: You can use NFT marketplace data websites like NonFungible to analyze prices and recent market activity.Bankless Resources on NFTs:📺 The Bull Case for NFTs with Jake Brukhman and Andrew Steinwold📄 NFTs and the On-Chain Spectrum2. NFT-based ERC20 TokensEthereum ERC20 tokens can be used to tokenize or represent anything, so naturally we’ve seen these tokens deployed across a range of instrumental use cases in the NFT ecosystem.For example, governance tokens like Rarible’s RARI or Axie Infinity’s AXS. These are projects which are NFT-focused and therefore, likely benefit from the boom in NFTs.These tokens allow holders to govern these projects from the bottom up and own them together as communities rather than being company-owned, top-down, and extractive in style.If these NFT projects grow considerably from here, demand for their governance tokens should grow in kind. Buying these tokens on DEXes like Uniswap is one way to gain exposure to the NFT ecosystem, though these particular assets can also be acquired through ecosystem participation (e.g. making buys or sells on Rarible or regularly playing Axie infinity).Source: axie.substack.comNext, there are utility tokens like Meme Protocol’s MEME and The Sandbox gaming platform’s SAND token. By utility tokens, I simply mean that these assets afford their holders some advantage or utility that’s impossible to access without holding them.For example, Meme Protocol is an NFT farming project that requires users to stake MEME in order to participate in its signature NFT drops, while the SAND token is the native currency used to pay for in-game experiences in The Sandbox universe.These assets can capture the growing demand for these NFT projects, so they’re another avenue to consider.The last category of NFT-centric ERC-20s to consider are fractional ownership tokens, like NIFTEX’s sharded NFTs or Metapurse’s B20 token.To dive in here, NIFTEX is a platform that lets users fractionalize their NFTs into easily tradable and liquid ERC-20 tokens. Accordingly, NIFTEX is a promising avenue when it comes to collective ownership of NFTs, and it already has some 20 NFT shard markets to choose from.Metapurse’s B20 token also employs a similar idea, as the group has fractionalized ownership of The Beeple 20 Collection artworks. With Beeple’s upcoming Christie’s auction, this could be a unique way to get exposure to his work and the potential upside that may come from the auction.If you think the underlying NFTs are going to go up in value, these fractional ownership tokens are an easy way to get associated exposure.3. Lend crypto to NFT usersThere’s a growing number of NFT holders who are interested in borrowing crypto against their NFTs on platforms such as NFTfi, a platform for NFT-collateralized loans.The takeaway? You can lend crypto peer-to-peer to someone who’s put up an NFT as collateral and earn interest for doing so. If the borrower defaults, you get rewarded with the underlying NFT collateral.Source: nftfi.com/app/lend/assetsIf this sounds like the kind of NFT x DeFi intersection you’re interested in, navigate to NFTfi’s Lending dashboard, connect your browser wallet, and then make loan offers on any of the listed NFT collateral propositions that suit your fancy.4. Buy NFT index fundsLastly, we’ve started to see the rise of NFT index funds that track baskets of similar NFTs.One of the pioneers here is NFTX, which is focused on building index funds that track the floor prices of specific NFT classes, like Zombie CryptoPunks or Origin Axies.In other words, you can buy fractions of the PUNK-ZOMBIE token if you want some easy, liquid exposure to Zombie CryptoPunks in your portfolio, and the same is true of the ORIGIN-AXIE when it comes to Origin Axies.These NFTX index funds have the most liquidity on Sushiswap currently, and the initial funds available for trading include:PUNK-BASIC (tracks the floor price of CryptoPunks)PUNK-FEMALE (tracks the floor price of Female CryptoPunks)PUNK-ZOMBIE (tracks the floor of Zombie CryptoPunks)PUNK-ATTR-4 (tracks the floor price of CryptoPunks with 4 attributes)PUNK-ATTR-5 (tracks the floor price of CryptoPunks with 5 attributes)PUNK (an index fund composed of NFTX’s various CryptoPunks indices)Non-Fungible Tokens - Wrapping UpThe NFT economy is heating up like never before. People are waking up to the potential of these assets. As a result, any savvy crypto investor should consider how they can capitalize on the current boom.There’s plenty of ways to get exposure. You can invest directly in NFTs, acquire NFT-centric ERC-20s or NFT index funds, or even lend crypto out to borrowers who want to use NFTs as collateral. But not without risk!Always exercise caution when investing in new assets and approach your personal NFT strategy with lots of due diligence and consideration of risks.The more thought you put into your collecting efforts, the better your chances at building up a strong NFT portfolio!Action stepsTry buying an NFT on OpenSea, Rarible, SuperRare, or NiftyGatewayTrade NFT-based tokens on Uniswap or SushiswapInvestigate NFT lending platforms like NFTfi",https://www.bankless.com/how-to-get-exposure-to-nfts,2021-02-23T00:00:00.000Z,"https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/image/fetch/w_1200,h_600,c_limit,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https-3a-2f-2fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com-2fpublic-2fimages-2f923de1fb-2488-40cd-b515-b934dd989b7e_1334x918.jpg",William M.

It’s because this design has the potential to solve a couple of problems that are present in current stablecoin systems. One major example is the lack of negative interest rates which could have helped a stablecoin like DAI during Black Thursday. Something like a negative redemption rate would have devalued DAI, and in turn, DAI holders would have been incentivized to sell and bring the market price down. A secondary effect of the redemption rate is that the protocol can create more or less demand for minting RAI even if people do not lock or withdraw collateral from the system. This is important because it means that the protocol has more discretion in setting its own monetary policy and thus attract or repel capital whenever it is needed. It also means that RAI does not fully depend on constant demand growth for locking ETH inside the protocol and can instead create its own incentives for keeping itself stable. A third argument for RAI is that its design can help make the system credibly neutral . There is no need to use bank stablecoins ( such as USDC ) as a collateral source in order to encourage RAI creation. This avoids the scenario where RAI becomes dependent on the fate of fiat backed coins and instead manages to detach itself from the traditional financial system. The Ideal Stable Asset At this point you might ask yourself: if a stable asset is trust minimized and has minimal external dependencies, is it somehow “better” than other alternatives? The simple answer is that it depends who you ask. Some people may prefer flexibility and opt for being able to upgrade a protocol in the long run. Others will choose the trustless option where, no matter what our differences may be, each one of us is free to leverage a protocol however we see fit and without thinking about how the rules may change. Both paths have their own merits and together they will contribute to a better future for DeFi. Action steps Explore Reflexer Labs’ RAI design Bankless Resources on the importance of trust minimization 🎙️ The Protocol Sink Thesis 📃 ETH is irreplaceable","Dear Bankless Nation,Do you want your money stable or trustless?Previously we’ve had to pick just one.Stablecoins like USDC have grown to over $40B in the past few years and have become widely adopted throughout DeFi. But there’s an elephant in the room. These crypto dollars rely on central banks, crypto banks, and the traditional financial system to hold and issue—they’re not trustless—they may be digital dollars with crypto superpowers, but they’re not bankless.And we can’t build a new financial system if we’re relying on the legacy institutions.Don’t get us wrong—crypto dollars are great. They’ll have a role in our decentralized future. But they fall on the stable not trustless end of the spectrum.ETH lands on the other side of the spectrum. It’s trustless not stable. On the Ethereum network, ETH has no trust dependencies. It’s baked into the base layer. Unfortunately, this also means ETH is extremely volatile which is not ideal for a money.Here’s the question: what if we could design a stable, trust-minimized form of money?What if we could remove the volatility from ETH while keeping it trustless? Wouldn’t that be the holy grail?That’s the goal of Reflexer Labs and RAI is how they hope to achieve it.Let’s dig in.- RSATHURSDAY THOUGHTGuest Post: Stefan Ionescu, Cofounder of Reflexer LabsWhy DeFi Needs Trust-Minimized Ethereum Stable assetsStable assets are the bedrock on top of which decentralized finance has flourished in the past few years.In 2020, the total market cap of stablecoins grew from $5B to more than $20B and exploding to over $40B in the early innings of 2021. The biggest winners were fiat backed stablecoins such as Tether and USDC which are now some of the main entry points for new users to experience the innovation happening in DeFi.Total stablecoin supply via The BlockThis sudden growth fueled more use-cases than ever before and incentivized builders to experiment with new models to bootstrap stable assets. At the same time, DeFi started to attract attention from regulators who looked to pass laws that can hamper open financial innovation.The best way to stop a revolution is to aim at its source. In DeFi’s case, you’d have to regulate or forbid the use and creation of stablecoins. Like any other obstacle our industry has faced, this can be circumvented with innovation and by eliminating trust assumptions from the protocols we build.The Need for Trust MinimizationAn example of a bill that was proposed last year targeted at the stablecoin sector was the STABLE Act. If the Act were to pass in its current form, stablecoin issuers would need to obtain a federal banking license as well as jump through multiple hoops in order to comply with financial regulations.Even though it may have been proposed with good intentions, the STABLE Act is just one of many more-to-come examples which gives an unfair advantage to existing, large players like central banks. In contrast, the main goal of stablecoins is to foster the creation and adoption of a parallel financial system that is open, transparent and efficient.Many developers, including myself, were attracted by the prospect of building money legos on top of a foundation that cannot shift beneath us. This foundation is being attacked and the way to protect it is to build stable assets with minimal trust assumptions.Trust minimization goes hand in hand with social scalability. It is easier for someone to adopt a currency if they know that they don’t need to trust a 3rd-party with its management and creation. Consequently, money is more useful when it is censorship-resistant, meaning that everyone is free to do whatever they please with it.Circling back to crypto, you can clearly see that developers are attracted by protocols such as Uniswap and Sablier which, even though they are not money, they act as neutral layers to manage value and build more sophisticated applications on top.These protocols are even more attractive when they leverage trust minimized monies, because the hard work of a developer that integrates with them cannot be ruined by any piece in the stack. This is an example of how governance minimized stable assets can be the source which contributes to the usefulness and security of everything that’s built on top of them. Trust-minimized foundations enable further trust-minimized applications to be built.In addition to social scalability, minimizing trust contributes to the overall security of a protocol. Protocols that can be governed will attract different ambassadors, each one with their own biases, motivations, and opinions on how things should change. The possibility of changing a protocol, while useful, opens the door for malicious parties to intervene and modify the rules in a way that benefits them at the expense of everyone else.Removing control from a protocol ensures that everyone is treated equally and few or no conflicts arise that can put the protocol in danger. Similarly, removing control from a platform meant to issue a stable asset can give more confidence to people using it.Sliding Down the Protocol SinkThe degree of trust minimization for a stable asset can be determined using The Protocol Sink Thesis. This thesis uses utility and attack surface to determine which protocols are more “dense” than others. A dense protocol falls further down the “sink” and is able to attract and support more applications without disrupting their operation. The utility of a protocol brings the need to shrink its attack surface which in turn makes the protocol even more useful.In order to build censorship resistant monies that slide further down the sink, stable asset issuers can guide their design decisions using the Uniswap Philosophy. This philosophy is a set of principles embedded in Uniswap which made it one of the most successful, trustless and widely integrated money legos.Let’s start with the automation principle. Uniswap does not need any outside input in order to function properly. The rules are clearly defined in the code and every participant knows what to expect when they interact with the smart contracts. While it may not be possible for a stablecoin crypto asset protocol to be completely automated, it can have clearly defined bounds for what is possible to change as well as a public roadmap to progressively become trust minimized.The second principle is self-sufficiency. Self-sufficiency is important because the protocol ensures its own survival simply by being used and without the need for benevolent actors to intervene. A protocol should be able to produce enough cash flow to attract more capital as well as offer rewards for updating its components (for example, oracles). Alternatively, a protocol may require that users pay for its maintenance when they interact with it.The last principle is the minimization of external dependencies. Protocols that have few or no connections to other applications have a smaller attack surface and thus they expose user funds to less risk. At the same time, the disadvantage of isolating a protocol is that it cannot benefit from the power of composability. There is a balance though: if every dependency is trust minimized, the possibility of an attack is reduced. All in all, stable asset creators need to weigh the different tradeoffs of integrating with other components.A Hidden External DependencyOne external dependency that all stablecoin projects have is the peg, which is usually meant to represent a fiat currency (such as the US Dollar) on-chain. Pegging to fiat, although popular, is the main reason why regulators are paying more attention to stablecoins. On top of this, pegging to another currency makes a stablecoin’s fate reliant on it.If we don’t peg, then how are we going to achieve stability? It’s an interesting question because when you look at popular currencies that other projects peg to, you will notice that they are not by themselves pegged to anything. This leads to an even more important question: is it possible to design a crypto-native stable asset that, similar to many fiat currencies, is not pegged to anything and is still considered “stable”?An early experiment shows that it may just be.RAIsing the Standard for a Stable AssetThe experiment mentioned above refers to Proto RAI, a demo of the recently launched RAI stable asset.PRAI redemption vs market prices during the mainnet demoRAI was built on top of the principles contained in the Uniswap Philosophy.It is a non-pegged, ETH backed stable asset which is meant to be governance minimized according to a specific schedule and following very detailed guidelines. It is also a new way to think about “stability” in the crypto space without having to bind a stable asset to an external reference point such as the US dollar.

RAI employs principles from control theory in order to stabilize itself. Its “moving peg” (or as I call it, the redemption price) can start at an arbitrary price (such as pi) and then the “peg” changes according to what RAI’s market price is on exchanges. The simplest, although not fully accurate way to describe RAI’s mechanism is as follows: if the market price of RAI is above the redemption price, the protocol will determine how fast the redemption price will start to go down.This means that each unit of RAI inside the protocol will progressively be worth less compared to one unit of ETH. Concretely, this means that each RAI holder will start to lose value and they are encouraged to sell, whereas each person that minted RAI using their ETH is encouraged to mint even more.How RAI is repricedOn the other hand, if the market price of RAI is below the redemption price, the protocol will determine how fast the redemption price will start to go up. This means that each unit of RAI inside the protocol will progressively be worth more compared to one unit of ETH. Moreover, it means that each RAI holder will start to gain value and they are encouraged to buy more RAI, whereas each person that minted RAI using their ETH is encouraged to repay their positions.In this game of “moving the peg around”, a change in the redemption price does not immediately result in a market price change. Rather, this is a game of expectations.For example, if I see the redemption price moving up and I don’t do anything, at some point someone who understands what the protocol is doing can start to buy more RAI (go long on RAI). Buying more RAI in this case is a self-fulfilling prophecy: if enough people go long on RAI, the market price will start to go up and follow the redemption price which has already appreciated. This results in a net gain for RAI holders and a liability for people who minted RAI with ETH because they now need to buy RAI at a higher price in order to close their positions.

In the other scenario where the redemption price is going down, someone who’s watching the protocol can start to short (or sell) RAI. Selling will make the market price go down and this way it will follow the redemption price which has already depreciated. This results in a net loss for RAI holders and a gain for people who minted RAI because they can now buy RAI from the market at a cheaper price than before and close their positions.

Aside from the redemption price, there is another, more important component in the protocol which is called the redemption rate. This is the pace at which the system modifies the redemption price and it gives everyone an idea of what “yield” they can get by going long or short on RAI. As an example, the protocol can say that the redemption rate is 0.5% per day, meaning that the redemption price will be 0.5% higher in 24 hours compared to the value it has right now. The redemption rate is a signal of whether it is worth it for you to long or short RAI (compared to taking other, unrelated opportunities in the market) and it entices people to take action with the system.The Value of RAI’s DesignAfter this entire walkthrough you might want to know: why build RAI instead of simply pegging to a currency and call it a day?It’s because this design has the potential to solve a couple of problems that are present in current stablecoin systems. One major example is the lack of negative interest rates which could have helped a stablecoin like DAI during Black Thursday. Something like a negative redemption rate would have devalued DAI, and in turn, DAI holders would have been incentivized to sell and bring the market price down.

A secondary effect of the redemption rate is that the protocol can create more or less demand for minting RAI even if people do not lock or withdraw collateral from the system. This is important because it means that the protocol has more discretion in setting its own monetary policy and thus attract or repel capital whenever it is needed.It also means that RAI does not fully depend on constant demand growth for locking ETH inside the protocol and can instead create its own incentives for keeping itself stable.

A third argument for RAI is that its design can help make the system credibly neutral. There is no need to use bank stablecoins (such as USDC) as a collateral source in order to encourage RAI creation. This avoids the scenario where RAI becomes dependent on the fate of fiat backed coins and instead manages to detach itself from the traditional financial system.The Ideal Stable AssetAt this point you might ask yourself: if a stable asset is trust minimized and has minimal external dependencies, is it somehow “better” than other alternatives?The simple answer is that it depends who you ask.Some people may prefer flexibility and opt for being able to upgrade a protocol in the long run. Others will choose the trustless option where, no matter what our differences may be, each one of us is free to leverage a protocol however we see fit and without thinking about how the rules may change.Both paths have their own merits and together they will contribute to a better future for DeFi.Action stepsExplore Reflexer Labs’ RAI designBankless Resources on the importance of trust minimization🎙️ The Protocol Sink Thesis 📃 ETH is irreplaceable Author BioStefan Ionescu is a Cofounder of Reflexer Labs.

- @morewoke in Clubhouse2. Over $100M in NFT sales in FebruaryOkay, it’s one thing that artists like to produce NFTs…but just because they exist doesn’t mean that people will buy them.So, are people buying NFTs?Yes, yes they are.Beeple sells $6.6M worth of NFTs on Christies3LAU sells $3.6M NFT in a Tokenized Album SaleNY Times: Why an Animated Flying Cat With a Pop-Tart Body Sold for $600,000NBA Top Shot leads NFT explosion with $230M in sales$90M of on-chain NFT sales in FeburaryGrimes Auctioning Off 10 Pieces of NFT Digital ArtworkThis is the incentive that’s going to bring in every artist with a following. Minting and selling an NFT is infinitely easier than working with an agency, with 1,000x more upside. Every artist is about to drop their agent and learn how to use Metamask.I think Beeple’s $6.6M sale on Christies is particularly interesting, because of Christies’ audience. Christies is an auction house for ‘fine art’ (wealthy older people).The fact that digital goods are being sold to older art speculators for $6.6M implies that we are skipping over the “does a digital scarce token have value?” conversation and going straight to “yes”.3. Digital Art is IntuitiveWhile I’m personally surprised that older cohort of art collectors are hopping on the NFT train so easily digital art is an obvious fit for younger generations. For Zoomers…the NFT revolution is perfect. Zoomers aren’t gonna ask “why does this have value?” They’re gonna buy it just like all the other digital goods they buy.Digital value is obvious for Zoomers.The best evidence for this is Logan Paul—one of the world’s biggest YouTubers. He’s selling out his 15-second ‘moments’ of his Pokemon Card reveal videos.Get this: People paid up to $20,000 for an NFT clip of a “moment” in which Logan Paul revealed what Pokemon cards were in the packs that he was breaking open.No, he is not selling the card or anything else. He is selling ‘the moment’. And they’re selling out at a $20,000 price tag!!Honestly, I don’t understand this at all, but hey, who am I to say what Zoomers want to pay for ¯\_(ツ)_/¯4. All Types of Art, Every Kind of ArtistRight now, NFTs are primarily about visual art, but other mediums of creation aren’t far behind.Here’s an audio track + visual art NFT minted by Gramatik, sold for $25,000. As mentioned above, 3LAU is getting creative with album and song NFTs:Musical artist Grimes is also experimenting with music / video art hybrids on NiftyGaeway, and this hybrid model is some of the dopest stuff I’ve seen. Oh yeah, and some of these initial art pieces are selling for ~$100,000.An Overnight RevolutionNFTs are an overnight revolution in how creators are able to create and monetize, and how their fans are able to express their fanship.This changes everything.While not everyone has realized it yet, I think the game is done. The old guard lost and Ethereum won. Now, we just have to build out more infrastructure and tooling around NFTs, and I expect to see massive amounts of funding throughout 2021 to do so.I remember when Andrew Steinwold boldly predicted that the NFT universe would be 100x larger than the DeFi Universe on the Bankless Podcast. At the time, I thought this was kinda ridiculous, but now I can see how prescient that was.Nice call Andrew.Congratulations to all the current and future artists that NFTs will monetize. I’m happy to see Ethereum return value back into the hands of the people that made it in the first place.The era of NFT-powered digital art is upon us!

There are esoteric terminology, slang, and memes, and people are versed in their ability to express these things through purely digital means.The crypto-economic foundations that make up this industry, Bitcoin and Ethereum, are responsible for creating the environment from which crypto-culture has been established. The specific flavor of cultural expression found in crypto-culture is directly downstream of the code that produces Bitcoin and Ethereum. The values that are baked into these crypto-economic systems extend outwards from the code itself and into the community, and the art that we share and value.There is a relationship between the nature of the cryptography that underpins these systems and the resultant communities that come to surround them.Value: A Collective AgreementIf something has value, it’s because humans collectively agree that it does. ‘Value’ is true because humans make it so. It’s a myth maintained by the social layer shared by the collective.Value is intangible, yet it is a powerful unifying force of everyone that shares the myth. Because all humans know all others believe in the same story, value becomes self-fulfilling.Value: the monetary worth of something; the importance or usefulness of something; a fair return or equivalent in goods, services

Values: a person's principles or standards of behavior; one's judgment of what is important in life.The assets that humans value are determined by our values. The market value of our financial assets is derived from our values created by the ethic that we live by.The true power behind the cryptocurrency revolution is its ability to eliminate the is-ought gap between what humans value and human values. With crypto, humans have the tools to become more closely aligned with how we desire to be.The net result of crypto is the production of new cultural-expression vehicles that enable humans to express their values with fidelity.This is critically important and is perhaps the prime reason to why this industry is so massively revolutionary. Humanity is perpetually on a mission to discover ways to express what it sees as ‘good’, and crypto offers a platform that makes this process more effective, efficient, and accurate.Most humans are ‘Good’ and want to do Good things for the world. Most humans wake up with the intention of helping improve society in whatever ways they can, while still making ends meet and living a comfortable life.Our ability to achieve Good results depends on the systems that humans use to organize and coordinate. Not all organizational systems are equally capable of enabling humans to successfully achieve the desired results of being 'Good.' Certain environments and human organizational schemes enable the expression of more Good than others. Environments flushed with resources make it easier to reduce suffering and to spread wealth, which is Good, but there’s variability in how humans manage to organize inside the environment they find themselves in.It’s one thing if there are ample resources, but being able to distribute these resources in Good ways requires organizational scaffolding to enable it.Organizational SchemesAs discussed in A Bankless Nation, humans have organized and then reorganized themselves under different schemas across time, and these organizational schemas tend to be more and more socially scalable. Steve Jobs said ‘technology is a bicycle for the mind’ implying that innovations in technology enable the human brain to achieve more with less effort. Extrapolating that from the single human brain to the collective human hivemind, new and improved human organizational schemes (Feudalism, Religion, the State, Democracy, the Internet, Crypto) are enabled by innovations in social coordination technology.Our ability to organize and focus our energies is mediated by the technology we have at our disposal.Crypto offers new social scaffolding that allows us to better distribute our valuable resources in a way that is better aligned with our human values.Learned HelplessnessLearned Helplessness is a term coined by Martin Seligman, a pioneer of the Positive Psychology movement.Learned Helplessness is a condition in which a person suffers from a sense of powerlessness, arising from a traumatic event or persistent failure to succeed. It is thought to be one of the underlying causes of depression.Learned helplessness is related to the concept of self-efficacy; the individual's belief in their ability to achieve goals. Learned helplessness theory is the view that clinical depression and related mental illnesses may result from such real or perceived absence of control over the outcome of a situationLearned Helplessness in SocietySocietal institutions are entrenched. Wealth isn’t circulating. Attempts to climb the social ladder and achieve the ‘American Dream’ are thwarted. Millennials are the first generation in history to believe that they are going to be worse off than their parents. Home-ownership in young people is down. Inflation-adjusted income is down. Debt is up; both in student loans and credit cards.A young person’s positive beliefs about the future are at all-time lows.Millennials and Zoomers are the two current generations in which positive beliefs about the future are critically important. These two generations need to be positive about the future, as it's the primary source of motivation to get out of bed in the morning and work towards achieving goals. Young adults need to believe that they have the power to positively impact their own lives and the lives of the people around them, via their own agency and self-actualization.If they don’t learn that these things are possible now, then these generations may become stuck in a state of learned helplessness.If you believe that the future is going to be worse, building motivation to expend the energy to try and build a better future will be difficult. If you don’t believe that you have the ability to direct your own personal future for positive outcomes, then why bother to even try? Keep your head down, go to your 9-5, come home, and watch Netflix. At least Netflix is only $12 a month. If you meal prep and don’t eat so much avocado toast, you may even be able to pay off your credit card!Meanwhile, Millennial and Zoomer memes about depression, suicide, and loneliness are relentless on Instagram and Reddit. If a meme catches traction, it’s because many people can relate to it.Internet memes are a way for young people to express their emotions and offer a way to funnel their depression and pessimism into a creative outlet. We should take notice that a common way to establish commonality and express oneself with internet strangers is via memes about depression, suicide, and loneliness. While these are intended to be a lighthearted jest, they are also the product of the environment that Millennial and Zoomers find themselves in.Society is in a state of Learned Helplessness…and it’s because our institutions are rigid, fixed, and designed to protect entrenched players and to protect the status quo.Unhelpful InstitutionsThe institutions that were erected after the Great Depression and WWII produced one of the most progressive periods of human history. The 1950s to 2008 was one of the greatest periods of economic prosperity and technological advancement humanity has ever had.But just like everything else in this universe, institutions age. What was originally built to benefit all of society now only works for a small part of society. Older generations were able to enjoy the best years of these newly established institutions, and they latched onto them and never let them go. Rather than passing the torch to younger generations, and allowing the institutions of the 21st century to adapt, evolve, and be inclusive of further generations, older generations instead captured these 21st-century institutions and sucked them dry.The older generations are still steering the Ship of Wealth, and declining to pass control down the line.The last 5 presidents of the United States have been Baby Boomers. The United States has been led by a Baby Boomer since 1992—that’s my entire lifespan.‘Research Leadership’ or the direction that we focus our energies into “Society R&D” is a Baby Boomer-lead movement.At the same time that student debt is reaching critical levels, University administration is inflated and leadership decisions are made by Baby Boomers.It takes roughly the lifespan of one long human life for a social institution to be birthed, mature, then age and become decrepit and senile. The generation that happens to be in their prime working years during the era in which institutions are at their best latch onto these institutions and capture all the value that they create.By happenstance, the generation that was positioned to take advantage of the prime years of these new institutions uses this era of prosperity and wealth to further expand these institutions to their maximal degree, as these generations believe that these institutions are ‘Good’.Obviously they believe that these institutions are ‘Good’, because of how much value and wealth they created from the relevant generations!These new institutions are wealth-generating machines and the generations that benefit from this wealth-generation latch onto the institutions and proliferate them into monolithic gargantuans that grow to commandeer the lives of everyone.The generations that helped create these institutions never pass up the helm of the ship. They continue dictating the direction of everyone under the umbrella of these institutions, even though they were erected under completely different leadership, under completely different paradigms. Society and generations move on, but the institutions stay the same. Eventually, there is such a large discrepancy between the needs of society, and what the institutions in power are is capable of offering.As a result, the generations that come after these lucky generations receive less and less of the wealth that is created by these institutions, as the prior generations find more and more ways to capture all the value that is produced.The wealth does not trickle down.Because these institutions never find new leadership, new brains, new innovators, and new entrepreneurs, they begin to age just like the people that compose them. Eventually, they turn old and senile too, and the social leadership these institutions offer is fundamentally misaligned with the desired goals of subsequent generations that came after them.As a result, the social institutions reject the young folk, the young folk reject the institutions, and a societal crisis occurs.In 2020, both the Left and the Right in America took to the streets and rioted.“Distrust in institutions is at an all-time high”“Wealth inequality”Younger people are increasingly pessimistic that we will be able to ‘vote’ our way out of our issues because the older generations never seem to acknowledge their perspective them get their way (see the 2020 Democratic Primary with Bernie vs. Biden).Instead of playing the society game, younger people seem to just rather ‘opt out’ and make memes about depression and helplessness. They have learned that they cannot succeed in this environment, because the institutions are not on their side.New Institutions, New CultureYounger generations are in dire need of new institutions.We can see this in the ways they attempt to express themselves in their culture. Younger generations are in a state of learned helplessness, as they struggle to discover where they fit in today’s society. Many are discovering that they actually can’t find themselves a niche to build and excel in, and instead find ways to compromise on their expectations about the future and learn to be satisfied with minimum wage jobs and living with their parents.For younger generations, Crypto Culture is product-market fit. Our memes are hilarious, our conversations are efficient, and our lifestyle is digital. Crypto Culture offers a new landscape of both economic output and cultural expression, and it is specifically tailored to digital nomads, forum-surfers, laptop jockeys, counter-culturalists, content-producers, swipers, meme-artists, bloggers, internet squads… cypherpunks.The Cypherpunks Created Crypto CultureThe history of crypto doesn’t begin with Bitcoin in 2009; it begins with Martin Hellman, Ralph Merkle, Whitfield Diffie, Horst Feistel, Peter Elias, David Chaum, and many others who were critical to the rise of cryptography and the cryptographic systems that our industry relies on.What started out as a counterculture fight against the establishment for the freedom of cryptographic information has blossomed into crypto-economic systems that create the foundational substrate on which infinite crypto-cultures have been established.Cypherpunks know that cryptographic protocols make social structures. 

Cypherpunks don't care if you don't like the software they write. 

Cypherpunks know that software can't be destroyed.

Cypherpunks know that a widely dispersed system can't be shut down.

Cypherpunks will make the networks safe for privacy.

Cypherpunks write code.The story of the Cypherpunks is a story of permissionless creation. A group of people banded together under a commonly shared set of beliefs and values, each with unique capabilities to contribute towards something they believed in and stood for.The desire to create. A counter-culture of permissionless problem-solving. A disregard for nonsensical, outdated establishment norms. A readiness to escape from tyranny and oppression, and the willingness to venture into new lands.The foundation of all crypto-cultures is built on the backs of the cypherpunks.Infinite CulturesThanks to the efforts of the Cypherpunks, we have an alternative universe for money and finance. This realm is uninhabited and fertile. There are just two things missing in this new empty landscape: people and structures.The migration of people and their capital into this new realm has perpetually grown ever since the first Bitcoin block was mined in 2009. Slowly but surely, people have been migrating into this new digital realm and setting up camp. These initial pioneers of crypto are most culturally similar to the cypherpunks that established the foundation of this land in the first place: independent, adventuring creators who have a vision for the future outside of the status quo.Ever since Bitcoin was introduced in 2009, and especially since Ethereum was formed in 2015, the migrants into this digital realm have taken on different flavors than the purely Cypherpunk cryptographers. Each new community that arrives in the crypto-verse is a new spin on the OG cypherpunk culture, and each community brings something new to the table that expands the fold.One of the first communities that settled in the crypto-verse were the libertarian gold-bugs who saw the dormant potential that lay in Bitcoin.Each different application of the crypto-verse entices its own varieties of users to migrate over. After the ultra-libertarian goldbugs and early cypherpunks came more casual cohorts, all interested in a specific flavor of what crypto has to offer.Dogecoin brought in a cohort of internet memesters. (Nic Carter came in via Doge)Bitshares brought in economic tinkerers. (Rune Christiansen came in via BTS)Monero and privacy coins brought in the privacy-minded.But with the introduction of Ethereum, an entirely new dimension opened up.Ethereum enables applications that don’t want or care to be concerned with the fundamentals of what makes a crypto-economic system operate. App developers on Ethereum don’t have to worry about the hard problems of crypto-economics (monetary policy, security, consensus etc)The Ethereum protocol takes on the hard problems of crypto-economic system design and lets the application developers focus on what they want to focus on: producing their application.This is a massive boon to cultural creation. By eliminating the labor and energy that needs to be dedicated to blockchain design and sustainability, app developers can focus on creating value in their apps, and incentivizing a community to band together and circle around the campfire that the app creates.Sadly, Dogecoin is just another L1 blockchain masquerading as a meme, and much of its vibrant community from 2013 to 2016 has moved on.Dogecoin was not a place of final settlement for migrants looking to live inside the crypto-verse. Bitshares similarly was economically flawed and constraining to developers. While Monero and other privacy coins maintain a strong community, their growth hasn’t kept up with the rest of the crypto-verse. These systems have not proven to be sufficiently sticky for migrants to be convinced of settling there.This is the power of Ethereum’s application layer: a foundational substrate that creates economic viability for all possible forms of culture to be expressed.Early Micro CulturesThe 2018-19 bear market saw a mass exodus from the crypto-space. As capital leaves, so do the people. Yet, a few communities managed to hold on and kept their fires going. The Link Marines. The Synthetix Spartans. The Aave Avengers.These communities suffered through significant drawdowns in asset values. Then, they suffered through 2 more years of flat crypto-prices, before things began to pick up again. This was 2 years of poverty—2 years of communities contracting into their truest and most convicted believers.The Discord channels for these communities were the campfires that kept the energy alive through a long, cold winter. Community members turned into community leaders and tended to the fire to make sure it kept everyone warm.Culture was created in these shared experiences of unexciting, low asset prices, yet relentless optimism and conviction about a successful future. Each different bear-market-community generated its own style of memes, jokes, and coping mechanisms as they waited out the winter together.And then spring came. AAVE, SNX, and LINK violently ended their bear markets by completely rejecting the pessimism expressed by all other assets in crypto, and lead the charge into DeFi Summer 2020 and where we are today in the markets.DeFi Summer happened, and out of it came the communities of Yearn, Sushi, Yams, Harvest, and many more, each with massive treasuries to help fund the development of both the product and the community.Each ecosystem has its own contributors, investors, developers, leaders, organizers, memers, or just believers. Some don’t do much other than sitting at the campfire and be present, and that is enough.Each ecosystem has its own culture, and that culture is alive due to shared conviction and sufficient funding via a collectively-owned asset.The asset makes the community, and the community makes the asset.These communities and their shared cultures are amplified via the financial and economic tool that lies in their respective token. The token is the thing that funds these communities and allows them to tap into resources that help the community grow and proliferate. When these tokens go up in value, it brings in more community members who find resonance in the value of the token and the values of the community.NFTs are Vehicles for Cultural CreationThough it might seem like NFTs have burst out of nowhere and into the news, the phenomenon has been inevitable since 1975. That was when two academic computer scientists, Whitfield Diffie and Marin Hellman, made the public-key breakthrough that brought us modern cryptography, enabling security and privacy in an online world. Their discovery also opened up cryptography as a creative tool through which scientists could cleverly transport the conventions and regimes of physical reality to the newly burgeoning digital world. One of those innovators was cryptographer David Chaum, whose ideas made digital money possible. It was only a matter of time before Chaum’s cryptocurrency concepts became mainstream, especially when merged with another cryptographic innovation, the blockchain. If you could ascribe value to verifiably unique strings of bits used as money, why not other strings of bits that represented artwork, tunes, or slam dunks? And once you’ve made the transition into collecting blockchain valuables, you can get really creative.

It’s no accident that NFTs are going wild during our lockdown state, when so much of our lives are played out on Zoom, Twitch, Clubhouse, and Amazon Prime. Novelist William Gibson famously described cyberspace—what became the internet—as a “consensual hallucination.” On a practical level, digital reality is just as real as the stuff that hurts our knees when we bang into it. NFTs merge that illusion with our longstanding consensual hallucination that something void of intrinsic value is actually precious and fungible.

Our embrace of those hallucinations long ago overstepped what we once considered its bounds. Even when we’re somewhere, we’re somewhere else. If you don’t buy that, try not touching your phone for a day. So why shouldn’t our ideas change about what holds value? As new as they are, NFTs are just confronting us with the evidence of how much we’re already in the Matrix. 

We’re people who need Beeple.

- Steven Levy, WiredThe power that lies dormant under the innovation that is NFTs is about to erupt into the world of artistic creation.Justin Blau, more commonly known as 3LAU raised $12M in 24 hours by selling a combination of digital collectibles, exclusive music, and the rights to musical direction.In return, Justin was able to create a direct connection between his artistic creations, and a list of 60 people that put $12M into his pockets for the rights to these items. While Spotify is great for distribution, it sucks for data. That’s because Spotify keeps all the data for itself. It provides the artists with no insight into who their fans are, or the ability to communicate with them.3LAUs top 60 fans were willing to collectively pay him $12M, yet a platform like Spotify treats them like every other 3LAU fan… or worse: people listening via Radio mix.As a result of the NFT tokens Justin 3LAU issued on Ethereum, his fans were more capable of communicating their value of the music he produces.Intermediaries broker the emotional relationship between artistic creators and artistic consumers. With intermediaries replaced by financial and economic software on Ethereum, the expression of culture through the digital arts will be able to flourish.Art is simply the ability for an artist to strike the senses of the experiencer; what happens when we generate incentivization vehicles (tokens) for the funding and development of the digital arts?The emotional response humanity will be able to access from its art will be revolutionary.Lowering the BarriersEthereum democratizes finance, and what is happening with NFTs is just the beginning of democratizing the value derived from art. Suddenly, the sharpest and most precise financial tool ever created is in the hands of the content creators and artists of the world.Through the power of tokens, and at the scale of the Internet, Ethereum disintermediates the distribution of art between art creator and art consumer. We have already seen the immense amount of energy that ICOs sparked in 2016-2018, and ICOs made no sense at all. Yet, the takeaway was Ethereum’s innovation in “capital formation”.NFTs are taking the power of capital formation and directing it into the arts.Tokens are the tool for artistic creators of all scales to tap into the power of their creative energies and produce something of cultural expression. If the market values cultural expression, it will have the ability to communicate this to the creator, 👏through👏the👏token👏.How many jobs will Ethereum create, by reducing the barriers for capital to flow into new lands of artistic creation? How many labor-hours can be redirected from meaningless tasks in gargantuan companies, into the land of free-market cultural generation?NFTs offer a way for the younger, digitally-native creators of the world to not rely on established and entrenched, permissioned, infrastructure to help fund their personal well-being.While the issue of large, misaligned social and political institutions are not simply ‘fixed’ by NFTs, NFTs offer a cypherpunk alternative to allow the younger generations to bypass these gatekeeping institutions, and empower them/us to secure a livelihood outside of the status quo.Not only do the legacy institutions of the world have to compete with the permissionless labor-monetization tools offered by Ethereum, but they also have to compete with the lifestyle that these tools offer: the freedom to work for oneself. No 9-5, no boss; just a creator and their computer.“…even a billion dollars of capital cannot compete with a project having a soul.”

- Vitalik Buterin, Endnotes on 2020: Crypto and BeyondThe Crypto Wealthy Will Subsidize Digital ArtIt makes logical sense that NFT Spring is occurring after DeFi Summer. It’s simply the correct order of operations. $ETH runs from $200 to $2,000, along with insane amounts of new issuance from DeFi tokens, and hundreds of billions of dollars gets injected into the ecosystem. Meanwhile, this high-powered growth also drives in funding and investments into companies and supporting infrastructure as well, adding in jobs and salaries into crypto.And now, this newly-created wealth is rotating out of Digital Finance and into Digital Arts.This is only, like, like the millionth historical example of this.From Tracing Renaissance art to the birth of modern banking:When it comes to the Renaissance, few of us would immediately equate the rich cultural fruits of the period with the birth of the modern banking system.

Entitled ""Money and Beauty: Bankers, Botticelli and the Bonfire of the Vanities"" the exhibition in Florence's Palazzo Strozzi looks at how Florence's famous families got rich -- and how they then used their wealth to commission works from some of the world's most celebrated artists.

""You could say that some of these gestures were simply penitential, but then the banker begins to realize that in giving them money he can also begin to define the image that is produced by his money, and of course one of the things he instinctively does, whether it's conscious or not, is to use the image to change the attitude to money, that is, begin to use the image to undermine the resistance to money,"" said Parks.

Money was feared, he said, not only because Christianity espoused poverty but crucially because it allowed for social mobility and therefore undermine the set Medieval hierarchies. Still, for a few years, the Medicis were in charge of papal finances.

…the artists were often happy to oblige in order to ensure their own economic prosperity.It’s simple: Society advances and learns how to create wealth and prosperity. Wealth naturally concentrates and generates a wealthy cohort of people, who have nothing better to do than to fund and finance the art that they wish to see created.Artists want to capture this wealth generated from innovations in finance and banking, and then they start making art that suits the taste of the wealthy.Entire revolutions in art have come and gone due to this cycle.Ethereum is the new frontier. We have completed the exploration of the Earth, and now the frontier of money, finance, and art has moved into the digital realm.The next cultural renaissance is digital, and it will be financed on Ethereum.ConclusionThe culture that is being cultivated in this space is a result of the awakening of younger people who are turning away from the notion of being simple cogs in the machine and are instead focused on becoming self-actualized contributors to the world.Andrew Yang warns of a world in which much of the world’s labor has been automated by machines and robots. We stand at a fork in the road where our future can turn into either a utopia or a dystopia.Without a place to redirect the energies of our younger generations into productive outputs, we will lose these generations forever to the basements of our parents, and the spirits of these generations could wither into nothingness. That’s a dystopia.But, with a place in which creative energies can be expressed and valued, we have the opportunity of automating away all the low-value work, and replacing it with time spent creatively. If robots are doing the labor, and humans are creating art, that’s a utopia.Let’s choose the latter—let the robots flip burgers and let the people create art.Let’s choose the future in which people are free from limitations on their paths towards producing a livelihood for themselves and others.Let’s choose Ethereum.

This post is strictly educational and is not investment advice or a solicitation to buy or sell any assets or to make any financial decisions. Do your own research.TOKEN THURSDAYGuest Writer: John Todaro, Head of Business Development at TradeBlockSUSHI Valuation Analysis & ModelSushiSwap is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange (DEX) and community-led AMM built on Ethereum.Over the last six months, SushiSwap has consistently ranked as one of the largest DEXs by trading volume and total liquidity. At time of writing, SushiSwap is averaging $200-400 million in notional trading volume everyday and has generated over $100M in cumulative revenue since launch.Recently, SushiSwap initiated a process whereby a portion of trading fees across the platform are paid out to token holders. With this initiation, investors and market participants can now receive rewards in a productive asset through an ownership stake. Moreover, assets that pay out a reward can be valued on a more quantitative level as rewards can be modeled into the future in a somewhat predictable fashion.I built out a valuation model that approximates an intrinsic value for the SushiSwap platform and corresponding native token, SUSHI.This article breaks down this process and how I arrived at an intrinsic value of ~$100 for SUSHI.SushiSwap tokens: SUSHI and xSUSHISushiSwap’s native token, SUSHI, is a ‘governance’ token whereby the community votes on all major changes to the protocol. While a number of DEXs offer similarly structured governance tokens, SushiSwap is one of the first to initiate a payout to token holders—this payout comes from the pool of trading fees that are collected on the platform.When market participants trade on the SushiSwap DEX, a 30 basis point fee is charged. A 5 basis point fee is added to the SushiBar pool in the form of LP tokens for the relative pool which are then sold for SUSHI. The newly bought SUSHI is divided up proportionally across xSUSHI holders in the pool—with xSUSHI holders receiving these tokens.The net effect of this fee payout is similar to a dividend in traditional equity markets and allows for token holders to accrue value in a productive asset.This represents one of the first instances whereby a token project has an incentive mechanism built in whereby token holders can share or participate in the fees that are accumulated on a protocol. I would expect in the future other governance tokens to initiate similar models whereby token holders can participate in fee accruals.⚠️ RSA Note: Let’s talk about the reason some DeFi tokens haven’t added cash flows—SEC regulation! The elephant in the room: if a DeFi project team is located in the U.S. or not pseudonymous they’re less likely to rush the addition of cash flows into their token even if it makes sense. This leaves “token governance” to vote to add the cash flows at a later date.📺 We talked to 0xMaki about this recently on the podcast.Valuation Model Basics & AssumptionsIn traditional equity markets, dividend paying stocks are often valued by discounting future cash flows to the present by an expected discount rate—a model which is aptly called a ‘dividend discount model.’These discounted cash flows from future periods are then summed together to create a total net present value (PV). In this model, I utilized historical trading volumes and fees to build a starting point for calculating cash flows.Because the first full year of dividends is not yet known, I projected cash flows out for the remainder of the year assuming volume growth over the last three months continued at a similar rate for the remainder of 2021. This is period 0 in the model.In periods 1-5, I projected out growing cash flows that waned in further out periods (years 3-5) as the DEX market likely becomes more mature and saturated. As such, the projected volume growth rate resembles an J-curve. This is common modeling in early stage companies that see accelerated growth in early years before slowing over time.After year 5, I calculated a terminal value for the network—this is the net present total value of the network from successive years projected into perpetuity.Rate assumptionsDiscount rate: 25%Terminal growth rate: 3%Fee growth in periods 1-5: ~10xTrading fee rate: remains steady at 5bpsThe terminal growth rate was modeled at 3% annually, which is inline with the broader industry and economy at large. In such models, it is typical to model the terminal growth rate inline with the GDP of the country the company resides in. In the US this is typically between 1.5-4% per year.The discount rate was placed at 25%. In early stage networks and companies a 25% discount rate is fairly standard.The discount rate is calculated by taking bond yields—typically the 10-yr (effectively deemed the risk free rate) and adding in some risk component. SushiSwap is a new entity and as such carries a considerable risk over traditional companies and more mature networks.However, SushiSwap has been around for close to a year and has seen a reliable user base with a fairly transparent team and governance structure—as such the risk should not be too significantly higher than similar endeavors.This rate can still be tweaked depending on assumptions and a rate of between 20-40% would also be deemed appropriate. In the past I have done work on building out a discount rate that is unique to cryptocurrency projects—this can be found in a Medium blog post from 2018. The discount rate can be quantified as the ‘cost of tokens’.Note that as bond yields rise, discount rates also rise and as such the value of the network is decreased—especially if a large portion of a network’s cash flows are from periods farther in the future. Over the last six months we have seen bond yields rise considerably from 0.6% to 1.6%.Because SushiSwap’s discount rate is still quite a bit higher than bond yields, even a large re-pricing in bonds will not significantly impact the NPV of SUSHI.SushiSwap modelAs shown in the figure above, taking into account my assumptions which I would deem as fairly base case and assuming the overall market continues to grow, SushiSwap has a current intrinsic market value of ~$12.64 billion and a token value of ~$100.There are considerable risks in the market including a drawdown in DeFi cryptocurrency trading, which would severely impact SushiSwap’s volumes and hence trading fees.A rise in competitors which can fork various aspects of the project as well as competition on liquidity/fees/and volumes would also negatively impact SUSHI.

Disclaimer: I am a heavy user of Ethereum and an occasional user of Binance Smart Chain.A Primer on the Binance EcosystemA lot has been said with regards to Binance Smart Chain. Just three weeks ago it was the main topic in crypto. Since emotions have already subsided and all seems quiet on the western front, we can now zoom out and look at things calmly—without all the noise.Before we start, let's make a distinction between Binance, Binance Chain and Binance Smart Chain:BinanceOne of the largest centralized exchanges—no need to go much deeper here. However, it's worth noting that Binance is also an umbrella brand for the overall Binance ecosystem—a true behemoth in the crypto world, containing a venture fund, project launchpads, an incubator lab, a charity fund...you get the idea.Binance ChainThis is the first blockchain network under the Binance brand. It uses Tendermint and thus it can be seen as part of the Cosmos ecosystem.It was launched in 2019 and it was deliberately designed to not support smart contracts. With that, the main use case was trading via Binance DEX—a ‘decentralized’ exchange used to bootstrap liquidity of multiple non-ETH projects, including Thorchain. Thorchain also currently uses it (BEPswap resides on Binance Chain). I couldn't find the details about validation. The FAQ says:“Binance Chain uses BFT and PoS (upcoming) based consensus mechanism to produce blocks among a series of qualified Validators...The process for setting up validators among different entities on Binance Chain is currently being defined.”It's safe to assume that the validator set of the Binance Chain is centralized.Binance Smart ChainBinance leadership was not satisfied with lagging adoption of Binance Chain. While alternative ecosystems were busy building the basic rails, the wave of innovation with DeFi was concentrated on Ethereum. Acknowledging this, Binance forked Ethereum EVM and bootstrapped a second blockchain—Binance Smart Chain, with support of smart contracts.It's essentially an Ethereum copycat with increased throughput and a centralized validator set of 21 validators handpicked by the leadership (kinda like EOS). They call it PoSA = Proof of Staked Authority.

Having two blockchains under one brand is pretty confusing and I am not sure why they didn't name it differently. However both blockchains now reside on the main Binance domain and form what Binance calls a “dual-chain architecture”.(If this sounds confusing to you, imagine being a newbie who just started trading on Binance and having the option to withdraw your coins to Ethereum, Binance Chain and Binance Smart Chain).While we could go in many directions from here now that we have a basic understanding of the Binance ecosystem, the rest of the article will focus on The Good, The Bad and The Ugly of Binance Smart Chain.The Good, The Bad and The UglyThe GoodDoes it make sense to use BSC? Was it a wise decision for Binance to build it? Is it good for the overall crypto ecosystem? Let's look at the positives:1. Low feesThere is no way around it, Ethereum mainnet is currently severely congested as transactions cost hundreds of dollars and contract deployment costs thousands. No matter how bad you want decentralization, if you are priced out of Manhattan, you want the next best alternative. And thanks to Binance Smart Chain, you can taste the DeFi experience with composability, high yield and smooth UX in a low fee environment.That being said, many alternative chains boasted with low fees and high TPS and went nowhere. Surely, BSC needs to offer more than just that! For some reason many users and devs picked this particular suburban area over other cheaper alternatives.

2. Developer experienceOne of my strongly held opinions in crypto is that developer experience is one of the most crucial aspects for adoption. If your protocol doesn't offer dev experience—an environment that makes it easy for independent devs to tinker with and build on, to quickly deploy and iterate—nothing else matters for adoptions. Not your token price, not influencers, no shiny logo and flashy website, nor partnership announcements.

I work with a couple of projects that build on alternative layer ones and even though some offer various advantages over Ethereum, one thing is always painfully clear.Ethereum and the EVM have years of a head start when it comes to developer experience. The solution was here earlier and many companies (spearheaded by Consensys) spent years and tens of million of dollars to build out developer infrastructure to support the Ethereum ecosystem.Binance Smart Chain cleverly bypasses this need by simply adopting EVM. With it they can easily roll out their fork of Etherscan, Metamask support, and a range of other products and tools popular on Ethereum.If you are a developer who just wants to experiment quickly and cheaply on a live network that has most of the tooling of Ethereum, liquidity and users, BSC is probably a good way to go.Whatever you build there can be later on ported to Ethereum main net.3. Liquidity and composabilityIn summer 2020, a whole new level of crypto experimentation emerged. It needed two key ingredients:Liquidity: Thanks to token incentives, lending protocols and decentralized exchanges attracted enough liquidity to be viable alternatives to their centralized counterparts.Composability: When base DeFi protocols (mostly lending platforms and AMMs) became liquid enough, other derivative DeFi products, such as yield aggregators could be built and used at scale.What followed was a Cambrian explosion in DeFi. And while it happened on Ethereum, note that decentralization (while very important) was not a necessary ingredient to this!Binance realized that they don't need decentralization to ride the wave. They just need the two key ingredients mentioned above. They already have enough liquidity. Binance boasts probably the biggest retail user base in crypto, and huge capital reserves to be deployed at their will.Composability was solved by forking EVM and incentivizing builders to copy the most popular DeFi projects. Thus CeDeFi was born. A pretty cringey term, but it somewhat reflects the reality of BSC.

I believe liquidity is one of the key differentiators between BSC and other lowcost EVM ecosystems such as xDAI. We are building finance, surely having a lot of money helps!🧠 Author’s Note: There are some accusations of BSC being dominated by fake volume. While Binance probably uses a lot of its idle capital to bootstrap liquidity, Rewkang in his recent tweetstorm debunks the notion that BSC is not used by actual users.Data show that there is indeed a lot of genuine activity, at least on PancakeSwap, a major DEX for BSC.4. CompetitionLet's not forget that the free market is driven by profit and competition. The crypto exchange business is very lucrative but also extremely competitive, and big players such as Binance need to take any advantages they can get so they can fend off competition.If Binance can use their resources to create a semi-open DeFi ecosystem centered around their brand and exchange, if they can capture their users within their ecosystem and drive value of their token and equity, they should do it.If they can fork a free open source code and use it to capture value within their business, they should.Copying is also a viable business strategy and no amount of angry finger pointing changes that. In the world of business pragmatism rules. While Ethereum researchers and devs painstakingly move the space forward, they generate public goods in the form of freely available open source software.Where alternative layer ones are trying to re-build blockchain primitives from scratch, Binance just plucked low hanging fruit of readily available open source to its full benefit.Thanks to BSC, in the short to mid term, Binance is forming a powerful crypto-financial ecosystem with their CEX in the middle and BSC surrounding it. I have no doubt that they will be able to capture a lot of users but at the same time will serve as an on-ramp and learning ground for newbies to enter crypto ecosystem “on rails”.

Thus, such competition is also useful for native Ethereum and DeFi ecosystem. Competition in the form of Binance gives us a reality check and pushes us to innovate. Some DeFi apps are extending to BSC to capture the business value there, others are pushing to innovate on L2s and scale other ways. The only thing that is not an option is remaining complacent in the status quo. End users will be the one benefitting the most.
5. DecompressorWhile we can argue that BSC is sucking out some liquidity out of Ethereum, I don't think we should be worried.Some users certainly are leaving to take advantage of cheaper fees, but most of them were priced out from Ethereum anyway. Eventually a natural equilibrium will form until other scaling solutions are available.In the short term, BSC acts as an emergency valve to lead the pressure away. What I also noticed is that the majority of short term oriented DeFi projects and money grabs also moved to BSC, thus improving the quality of the average DeFi Ethereum project.The BadNow that we’ve highlighted the good aspects of BSC, I will try to argue from the opposite direction, dissecting the biggest weaknesses and negative externalities of BSC.1. Decentralization theaterThere is nothing bad with centralized services; however, it stinks if they try to act as if they have the same guarantees as decentralized. It's one thing to be attracted to BSC because of low fees, but it's another to rely on it with your money thinking you are on a permissionless, decentralized and credibly neutral settlement layer. 

While Binance Smart Chain is open (anyone can build on it), it's hard to argue it's decentralized, given the permissioned validator set, arguably under direct control of Binance leadership.

However, quoting 1inch’s founder, Sergej Kunz:“We don't know for sure if the BSC is centralized as we don't know who are the validators of their network. But 1inch plans to run its own validator on BSC.” 

Source: CoinTelegraphIt's very unclear how one can join these mythical 21 validators. The 21 validator system sounds similar to EOS, but even there you could delegate tokens and vote.There is no such mechanism with BNB.2. Lacking Credible NeutralityBinance has a tight control over it's border. Not only can they stop withdrawals to particular networks from their CEX at will. They can even shut down the bridge between BSC and other networks.
Of course this doesn't happen often in practice, but the mere possibility of this happening sheds away in trace of credible neutrality.I personally find credible neutrality very valuable and for this reason I am holding majority of my capital within a credibly neutral ecosystem, while paying a higher fee for it. I advise anyone to consider the BSC ecosystem as a more open and composable extension to their centralized exchange, rather than a decentralized ecosystem.This means that BSC is more akin to permissioned Ethereum sidechain (I’ll refer you to this awesome article to understand the nuance of sidechain definition).So in practice, you should regard your capital on BSC being under the same regime and rules as having them deposited on Binance CEX. When you bridge your assets from Ethereum into BSC, you get IOUs.There is of course nothing wrong with having your capital on custodial exchange. It is also highly improbable Binance would want to steal from you. I would even argue it's safer to trust Binance than some smaller sidechains, where the validators do not command a huge and valuable business brand with reputation at stake. Just do not conflate it with self custody of funds in a permissionless ecosystem such as Ethereum.🧠 Author’s Note: While Ethereum’s L1 is credibly neutral, you should be careful while using smart contracts and DeFi apps built on top of it, many are in fact akin to custodial, since they have admin keys or other ways to control your capital locked within them. However the difference still is whether they are built on a permissionless credible neutral layer, or another custodial, trust-based layer.3. Target marketIn the short term, BSC can capture the demand for “CeDeFi”—arguably a big market of users who don't care about credible neutrality and/or want low fees while enjoying yield farming and DeFi experimentation.Control over the network also enables Binance to more efficiently fight against hacks and rug pulls, and there is a wide group of users that certainly appreciate that.

However, Ethereum thanks to it's credible neutrality enables so much more. Apart from yield farms and liquidity pools, it fosters a wide range of financial and non-financial innovation, such as alternative governance structures, decentralized autonomous organizations, experiments with funding of public goods, privacy technologies. Arguably, these vectors of innovations are not viable on a centralized layer.Even though you can technically build it, you always run a tail risk of Binance leadership deciding (or being coerced) to shut you down.

Thus, while it may be advisable for some DeFi projects to expand into BSC or experiment there in a low cost environment, I also think no serious and long term thinking crypto project should choose BSC as the home of their “headquarters”.It is akin to building your business in a dictatorship instead of a democracy. While the dictatorship may be benevolent, you can't rely on it being benevolent years into the future. While I can imagine BSC evolving into a decentralized ecosystem (mostly changing their validator policy), I find it very unrealistic.

4. Technical challengesBinance tries to market BSC as some sort of tech innovation in scalability vs “slow and expensive” Ethereum.Let's make it clear once and for all, that BSC is not any sort of technological innovation. Only thing it does is move the spot on the Blockchain trilemma triangle from decentralization towards scalability, while changing very little technically.I believe in the long run, BSC validators will find it harder and harder to store all the state, since the bloat will become unbearable. E.g. within the generalized smart contract and feature rich DeFi ecosystem with many DEXes, lending platforms, trading venues, there will be an increasing amount of arbitrage opportunities.This is something that bothers Ethereum as well—too many DEXes on one generalized chain start to cannibalize the network. However, Ethereum has two ways to fight it:In the short term, the fee market makes fees increase and thus creates new equilibrium.In the long term, the majority of trading activity may be pushed to other layers, Zkrollups or Optimistic Rollups and scale heterogeneously.BSC can't really let the fees rise too much, since their value prop is to be cheap—not decentralized. BSC can scale with Ethereum, but without the world class researchers and developers that work on Ethereum they are destined to wait for Ethereum to innovate and fork the innovation. This can become a chore by itself, since Ethereum network is pretty much a work-in-progress.This doesn't mean Binance ecosystem won't remain powerful. Binance has money, users, marketing power and business acumen...but it is not a technical innovator by any means.I believe Binance will have to quickly follow the innovation while also trying to not be stretched too thin. With such a large and diverse ecosystem, it may prove more and more difficult to keep up.The UglyI tried to summarize both good and bad, pros and cons of BSC above. What is left is the ugly. The vitriol between communities and influencers. The marketing war and attacks.Crypto is a world where financial incentives clash with ideals, differences in values and technical nuances grow into tribalism and are amplified by bags being held.

There are cheek in tongue jabs by CZ hinting on Ethereum being unusable or 1inch (extending to BSC, while comparing Ethereum) to hellish scorched earthBut there are also blocked withdrawals to the Ethereum network from Binance. These are attributed to high gas fees, regardless of the fact that many users would happily pay high gas fees to withdraw in order to cover their CDPs and other endangered DeFi positions.We also see interesting attacks on BSC, ranging from technical, such as the Gastoken spam, to cultural and political like Tanks of Tiananmen and Slave Finance aiming to provoke a response—preferably a heavy hand of censorship.While the projects above are so far left uncensored, we have already seen another interesting case veiled in opacity.What looked like a $31m scam from Meerkat, a “CeDeFi” app on BSC, turned into a returned funds and lead dev apologizing and explaining it was “just a test”.I leave the readers to form their own opinion on what really happened.Tribalism and verbal fights are nothing new in crypto but withdrawal blocks and political attacks are still unprecedented, and we may see it escalating further between various competing entities and communities.I just hope it won't escalate too much and turn into a negative sum game for everyone involved.Closing remarksBSC is most likely here to stay at least for the mid term.I don't find the ecosystem particularly interesting, since I have already been through food coin craze and DeFi summer.If you are a serious crypto user and focus too much on it, you may miss more important developments happening elsewhere.

It serves as an attempt to view Binance Smart Chain objectively, however it's still just an op-ed piece and not a full summary nor a deep data driven research. If you find any factual mistakes in the article, please reach out for correction.

Disclaimer: I am a heavy user of Ethereum and an occasional user of Binance Smart Chain.A Primer on the Binance EcosystemA lot has been said with regards to Binance Smart Chain. Just three weeks ago it was the main topic in crypto. Since emotions have already subsided and all seems quiet on the western front, we can now zoom out and look at things calmly—without all the noise.Before we start, let's make a distinction between Binance, Binance Chain and Binance Smart Chain:BinanceOne of the largest centralized exchanges—no need to go much deeper here. However, it's worth noting that Binance is also an umbrella brand for the overall Binance ecosystem—a true behemoth in the crypto world, containing a venture fund, project launchpads, an incubator lab, a charity fund...you get the idea.Binance ChainThis is the first blockchain network under the Binance brand. It uses Tendermint and thus it can be seen as part of the Cosmos ecosystem.It was launched in 2019 and it was deliberately designed to not support smart contracts. With that, the main use case was trading via Binance DEX—a ‘decentralized’ exchange used to bootstrap liquidity of multiple non-ETH projects, including Thorchain. Thorchain also currently uses it (BEPswap resides on Binance Chain). I couldn't find the details about validation. The FAQ says:“Binance Chain uses BFT and PoS (upcoming) based consensus mechanism to produce blocks among a series of qualified Validators...The process for setting up validators among different entities on Binance Chain is currently being defined.”It's safe to assume that the validator set of the Binance Chain is centralized.Binance Smart ChainBinance leadership was not satisfied with lagging adoption of Binance Chain. While alternative ecosystems were busy building the basic rails, the wave of innovation with DeFi was concentrated on Ethereum. Acknowledging this, Binance forked Ethereum EVM and bootstrapped a second blockchain—Binance Smart Chain, with support of smart contracts.It's essentially an Ethereum copycat with increased throughput and a centralized validator set of 21 validators handpicked by the leadership (kinda like EOS). They call it PoSA = Proof of Staked Authority.

Having two blockchains under one brand is pretty confusing and I am not sure why they didn't name it differently. However both blockchains now reside on the main Binance domain and form what Binance calls a “dual-chain architecture”.(If this sounds confusing to you, imagine being a newbie who just started trading on Binance and having the option to withdraw your coins to Ethereum, Binance Chain and Binance Smart Chain).While we could go in many directions from here now that we have a basic understanding of the Binance ecosystem, the rest of the article will focus on The Good, The Bad and The Ugly of Binance Smart Chain.The Good, The Bad and The UglyThe GoodDoes it make sense to use BSC? Was it a wise decision for Binance to build it? Is it good for the overall crypto ecosystem? Let's look at the positives:1. Low feesThere is no way around it, Ethereum mainnet is currently severely congested as transactions cost hundreds of dollars and contract deployment costs thousands. No matter how bad you want decentralization, if you are priced out of Manhattan, you want the next best alternative. And thanks to Binance Smart Chain, you can taste the DeFi experience with composability, high yield and smooth UX in a low fee environment.That being said, many alternative chains boasted with low fees and high TPS and went nowhere. Surely, BSC needs to offer more than just that! For some reason many users and devs picked this particular suburban area over other cheaper alternatives.

2. Developer experienceOne of my strongly held opinions in crypto is that developer experience is one of the most crucial aspects for adoption. If your protocol doesn't offer dev experience—an environment that makes it easy for independent devs to tinker with and build on, to quickly deploy and iterate—nothing else matters for adoptions. Not your token price, not influencers, no shiny logo and flashy website, nor partnership announcements.

I work with a couple of projects that build on alternative layer ones and even though some offer various advantages over Ethereum, one thing is always painfully clear.Ethereum and the EVM have years of a head start when it comes to developer experience. The solution was here earlier and many companies (spearheaded by Consensys) spent years and tens of million of dollars to build out developer infrastructure to support the Ethereum ecosystem.Binance Smart Chain cleverly bypasses this need by simply adopting EVM. With it they can easily roll out their fork of Etherscan, Metamask support, and a range of other products and tools popular on Ethereum.If you are a developer who just wants to experiment quickly and cheaply on a live network that has most of the tooling of Ethereum, liquidity and users, BSC is probably a good way to go.Whatever you build there can be later on ported to Ethereum main net.3. Liquidity and composabilityIn summer 2020, a whole new level of crypto experimentation emerged. It needed two key ingredients:Liquidity: Thanks to token incentives, lending protocols and decentralized exchanges attracted enough liquidity to be viable alternatives to their centralized counterparts.Composability: When base DeFi protocols (mostly lending platforms and AMMs) became liquid enough, other derivative DeFi products, such as yield aggregators could be built and used at scale.What followed was a Cambrian explosion in DeFi. And while it happened on Ethereum, note that decentralization (while very important) was not a necessary ingredient to this!Binance realized that they don't need decentralization to ride the wave. They just need the two key ingredients mentioned above. They already have enough liquidity. Binance boasts probably the biggest retail user base in crypto, and huge capital reserves to be deployed at their will.Composability was solved by forking EVM and incentivizing builders to copy the most popular DeFi projects. Thus CeDeFi was born. A pretty cringey term, but it somewhat reflects the reality of BSC.

I believe liquidity is one of the key differentiators between BSC and other lowcost EVM ecosystems such as xDAI. We are building finance, surely having a lot of money helps!🧠 Author’s Note: There are some accusations of BSC being dominated by fake volume. While Binance probably uses a lot of its idle capital to bootstrap liquidity, Rewkang in his recent tweetstorm debunks the notion that BSC is not used by actual users.Data show that there is indeed a lot of genuine activity, at least on PancakeSwap, a major DEX for BSC.4. CompetitionLet's not forget that the free market is driven by profit and competition. The crypto exchange business is very lucrative but also extremely competitive, and big players such as Binance need to take any advantages they can get so they can fend off competition.If Binance can use their resources to create a semi-open DeFi ecosystem centered around their brand and exchange, if they can capture their users within their ecosystem and drive value of their token and equity, they should do it.If they can fork a free open source code and use it to capture value within their business, they should.Copying is also a viable business strategy and no amount of angry finger pointing changes that. In the world of business pragmatism rules. While Ethereum researchers and devs painstakingly move the space forward, they generate public goods in the form of freely available open source software.Where alternative layer ones are trying to re-build blockchain primitives from scratch, Binance just plucked low hanging fruit of readily available open source to its full benefit.Thanks to BSC, in the short to mid term, Binance is forming a powerful crypto-financial ecosystem with their CEX in the middle and BSC surrounding it. I have no doubt that they will be able to capture a lot of users but at the same time will serve as an on-ramp and learning ground for newbies to enter crypto ecosystem “on rails”.

Thus, such competition is also useful for native Ethereum and DeFi ecosystem. Competition in the form of Binance gives us a reality check and pushes us to innovate. Some DeFi apps are extending to BSC to capture the business value there, others are pushing to innovate on L2s and scale other ways. The only thing that is not an option is remaining complacent in the status quo. End users will be the one benefitting the most.

While the dictatorship may be benevolent, you can't rely on it being benevolent years into the future. While I can imagine BSC evolving into a decentralized ecosystem (mostly changing their validator policy), I find it very unrealistic.

The vitriol between communities and influencers.

However, for many users and developers it will remain a viable short term option, centralized but cheap and simple to use, with a lot of liquidity and retail users to target.We should just accept it and put an emphasis on unbiased education of new users while waiting for better scaling solutions.Action stepsExplore the good, the bad, and the ugly for Binance Smart ChainRead Fiskantes previous piece “Crypto Advice from a Poker Player”Author BioFiskantes is a is partner at Zee Prime Capital, CIO at Sigil Fund and co-founder of Crypkit.",https://www.bankless.com/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-of,2021-03-17T00:00:00.000Z,"https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/image/fetch/w_1200,h_600,c_limit,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https-3a-2f-2fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com-2fpublic-2fimages-2f6baa37a5-e848-4f56-bdea-d87b58a8c711_1400x700.jpg",Bankless,Bankless,blog,,Unknown Error

Chances are you’ve staked one or more of these tokens directly through the protocol’s native staking contracts and UI. Why not right? As time passes, you earn a share of protocol revenue or inflation and the value of your position grows. This is simple enough and, relative to some of the more novel financial primitives in this space, most DeFi investors understand the mechanics of staking. While staking may be easy to understand, it comes with its fair share of pitfalls. In many cases, staking is expensive, technical, time-intensive, tax-inefficient, capital-inefficient, not to mention incredibly restrictive. With all of that in mind, is it possible to design a set-and-forget solution that solves for these challenges—eliminating the burden on investors—while also providing holders with an opportunity to express a delegated governance position? That’s exactly what xToken is aiming to achieve. ✍️ Editor’s note : Each xToken is empowered with a specific governance mandate that will automatically vote on proposals based on the associated mandate—denominated with either an “a” or “b” on the asset’s ticker (i.e. xKNCa will vote differently than xKNCb). You can learn more on this on xToken’s governance blog","Dear Bankless Nation,Sometimes staking your DeFi tokens can be a pain.Claiming rewards every week can be costly and maybe even unprofitable for some—especially in the current gas fee environment.There are even some protocols that require you to regularly vote on governance proposals in order to be eligible for the rewards (more tx fees!!).But what if we could just hold a wrapped token that automatically accrued rewards?That’s xToken.With xToken, token holders can mint an xAsset by depositing popular DeFi tokens with staking opportunities—like AAVE, INCH, KNC, SNX, and others—and in return, receive an ERC20 token that’s automatically earning the underlying rewards.No claiming, no voting, no transaction fees. Just pure compounding returns.Powerful.Let’s explore xTokens today and see how we can automate our staking rewards.- RSATactic TuesdayGuest Writer: Michael J.

By holding an xAsset, token holders can automatically earn the protocol’s native staking rewards without having the need to claim or govern.Better yet, all rewards are automatically reinvested and compounded, providing holders with a capital efficient way to earn staking rewards.This tactic will dive into how xToken works, the possibilities with this design, the risks associated, and how you can mint your own xTokens in a few minutes.Goal: Automate your staking rewardsSkill: IntermediateEffort: 10 minsROI: Staking rewards, gas fee savings, and potential tax efficiencies!Introduction to xTokenIf you’re a Bankless reader, you’re probably familiar with DeFi blue chips like SNX, AAVE, KNC or 1INCH.Chances are you’ve staked one or more of these tokens directly through the protocol’s native staking contracts and UI. Why not right? As time passes, you earn a share of protocol revenue or inflation and the value of your position grows. This is simple enough and, relative to some of the more novel financial primitives in this space, most DeFi investors understand the mechanics of staking.While staking may be easy to understand, it comes with its fair share of pitfalls. In many cases, staking is expensive, technical, time-intensive, tax-inefficient, capital-inefficient, not to mention incredibly restrictive.With all of that in mind, is it possible to design a set-and-forget solution that solves for these challenges—eliminating the burden on investors—while also providing holders with an opportunity to express a delegated governance position?That’s exactly what xToken is aiming to achieve.✍️ Editor’s note: Each xToken is empowered with a specific governance mandate that will automatically vote on proposals based on the associated mandate—denominated with either an “a” or “b” on the asset’s ticker (i.e. xKNCa will vote differently than xKNCb).You can learn more on this on xToken’s governance blogWhat is an xAsset?An xAsset (or an “xToken”) is a set-and-forget staking wrapper that grows in value as a protocol’s native staking rewards accrue to the token. Each xAsset is slightly different depending on the staking mechanics of the base token being wrapped, but all are designed to gain value in base token terms.Let’s use xKNC as an illustrative example.A KNC holder visits xToken Market to mint xKNC. The minting process requires the investor to deposit KNC, and after an approval transaction and confirmation of the mint transaction, they receive xKNC in return.This is all an investor needs to do to earn compounding Kyber staking returns.The trade form to buy (i.e., “mint”) xKNCa on xtoken.marketAs time goes on, the conversion ratio between xKNC to KNC increases as value accrues to the xKNC pool.For those unfamiliar with KyberDAO, stakers are required to participate actively in governance in order to earn protocol fees—that means submitting one to three on-chain “vote” transactions over the course of each two week epoch.Additionally, stakers need to submit a “claim” transaction each epoch in order to retrieve their earnings (paid in ETH). All in, KNC stakers can easily spend $50 or more every two weeks managing their staking position.xToken abstracts this process by voting and claiming on behalf of the pool of holders. On claim, ETH earnings are reinvested in KNC and staked, increasing holders’ pro rata KNC value while paving the way for compounding returns.The Utility EscalatorWhile we’ve demonstrated how straightforward the utility and usage of xAssets can be for an investor, there are multiple levels to the xToken value proposition.Many users will be content settling for the above example—let’s call it “Level 1”.As described in the section above, investors benefit from significant gas savings and the peace of mind of a set-and-forget investment instrument.Full returns, no worries. That said, all holders of xTokens ascend to “Level 2” on the utility escalator, whether they realize it or not.Level 2Proceeding with the xKNC example, when KyberDAO ETH fees are claimed and reinvested in KNC, xKNC holders benefit from compounding returns. More KNC invested means more KNC staked, which means more ETH fees, which means more KNC invested. This is standard compounding interest which we all know and love.But by holding xKNC, investors access a second layer of compounding returns. In many locales, the act of claiming fees is a taxable event, registered at the “regular income” tax rate.That means that each ETH claim comes with 10%-50% of value leakage. While you should absolutely not take tax advice from xToken or Bankless, it’s quite possible that staking KNC unprotected will wipe out a significant portion of your gains.✋ This is not tax advice! Please talk to your accountant on the implications of holding xTokens and the taxable events associated with staking in your jurisdiction.xKNC solves this by providing an abstracted interface—a “wrapper”—for investing and staking KNC. You the investor are not required to claim. All you do is buy xKNC when you want in and sell xKNC when you want out.On redemption, you pay taxes on your profits, having benefited from full compounding with no value leakage along the way.Level 3The final level on the utility escalator concerns the role of xAssets in the larger DeFi ecosystem. We designed our funds with maximal composability in mind, empowering holders with xSNX or xAAVE to do whatever they can do with normal SNX or AAVE.The first example of Level 3 utility is devastatingly simple: users can transfer their fee-generating, value-accruing xTokens from wallet to wallet just like any ERC20.As it stands now, SNX, AAVE, KNC and 1INCH direct stakers cannot do this. Their tokens are locked in each protocol’s contracts with little hope of seeing the light of day.While some protocols mint stakers an IOU token (ex: “StakedAave” or “Staked1Inch”), these have a static value and do not generate revenue directly. And of course, users still have to claim and reinvest their rewards on their own.Now, with a composable, transferable, yield-generating token in tow, users can do a lot more than simply transfer their xAssets. As one prime example, investors can generate secondary income by LPing their xTokens on a DEX.🧑‍🌾 Yield Farmers! xToken is a few weeks into a ten week rewards program where xToken LPs earn XTK (xToken’s native token). Learn more about the program here.While we love supporting our friends at Uniswap, Balancer and 1Inch (and soon Bancor), why do we need xAsset liquidity on DEXs when users can just mint or burn directly on the xToken contracts?There are multiple reasons but xAAVE provides one simple, resonant example.All AAVE stakers are subject to a 10 day cooldown period, where they’re required to signal their intention to unstake 10 days before they actually do it. This is a necessary component of the Aave system, where stakers act as a backstop—or an insurance reserve—for the protocol at large.Without a cool down, stakers would be able to flee at the first signs of trouble. This cooldown period works for Aave, but poses UX problems for AAVE investors.In contrast, xAAVE is a liquid staking derivative that offers investors immediate liquidity. No need for the cool down. Instead you can just sell your xAAVE for ETH or AAVE on Balancer—instantly.In the long run, we foresee DEXs as the primary gateway for xToken trading. The AAVE cooldown requirement is a good example of a protocol-specific value prop, but in many cases, Uniswap is just more familiar to the average investor.Why learn the xToken UI when you can invest in our funds via your favorite DEX?There’s more to say about the importance of secondary liquidity for xToken, but we’ll have to save that for a future post. For now, let’s move on to the holy grail of the utility escalator: xTokens as collateral.xToken CollateralSimply put, investors and traders want leverage on their tokens. For investors bullish on DeFi, tokens like AAVE or KNC make great candidates for collateral. As price increases, more borrowing power becomes available. Between Compound, Aave, Maker, Cream and others, there are now hundreds of millions of dollars of DeFi tokens being used as collateral.These tokens do the trick as collateral. However, in most cases, they are earning nothing or next to nothing in interest. With the market strongly biased to the upside, there’s little demand to borrow these tokens to sell short. Sometimes the ‘Farm du Jour’ will offer a short term spike in borrow demand and interest fees, but lending rates on DeFi tokens are frequently below 1%.What if investors could earn the native staking returns of their tokens while using them as collateral?That’s what’s on the board next for xToken. In Q2, DeFi leverage-seekers will have this option available to them. We believe that there doesn’t have to be an opportunity cost of using your tokens as collateral. Enjoy your staking returns and your leverage too!How to Mint an xAssetStep 1: Head to our xToken Invest page.Step 2: Click on the xAsset you’d like to invest in. We’ll invest in xINCHb for this example. You can select ETH or 1INCH as the input token for your mint.🤓 Pro Tip: Always compare prices between direct mints on the xToken contract and available prices on a DEX. In this case, 1INCH Exchange offers a better entry price for xINCHb than a direct mint. For demonstration purposes however, we’ll continue with a direct mint.Step 3: Press ‘Review Trade’, review the risk factors, and submit the approval transaction.Step 4: Finally, submit the mint transaction!Once this transaction confirms, you’ll be an xINCHb investor! You’re now automatically earning 1inch staking rewards in a fungible ERC20 token.Risks of Using xToken ⚠️While our contracts are fully audited and have been running safely on mainnet for months, there is naturally extra risk to using xToken, relative to staking your tokens directly through the protocol. There’s always risk on the frontier!First, we’re building smart contracts on top of each protocol’s smart contracts, so you will be exposed to multiple layers of smart contract risk. Beyond the native protocol, we also integrate DeFi protocols like Uniswap and Set Protocol into our contracts, adding an extra layer of complexity.Second, each xToken fund manages exit liquidity a bit differently. In order to maximize returns, we often only maintain about 5% of capital available as exit liquidity at a given time. While we can always unlock more—and while we’re seeing growing secondary liquidity on DEXs—you may not always be able to find full, immediate exit liquidity for your position.Final ThoughtsA couple years from now, when you’re a sophisticated DeFi investor with a tens of assets in your portfolio along with various LP strategies, and even a healthy dose of leverage, it’s unlikely that you’ll be jumping from dApp to dApp managing your staking positions.It’s not convenient for the average investor, nor is it cost efficient, and you lose out on the potential for composability!By allowing xToken to do the low-level work for you, you can be empowered to maximize your capital and freed to spend time on the important decisions.For more info on xTokens, join our Discord or follow us on Twitter!Action stepsExplore xTokens and how it can automate your staking rewardsRead up on xToken’s governance blog to understand each token’s gov mandateAuthor BioMichael J.

Economies are integrated systems which consume resources and produce economic output. Economic engines are evaluated on their power-output, measured in Gross Domestic Product.In order to maintain operation, economies must be protected by some kind of powerful force. Economies produce value, and are therefore desirable; if they are desirable, they must be guarded. If economies are not meaningfully protected, then the incentive to try and capture the economic system may outweigh the costs of trying; therefore the economy is exposed, and an attack can be expected.An integrated relationship is established between the three parties that make up an economy:The Coordinating Body (the leadership, government, or ‘party in power’)The Economic Power (the productive output of the economy)The Protective Force (the army, militia, or defense force of a Nation)When these three parts of an economic system are composed together, they create a ‘Nation-State’, a composed integrated body of productive internal organs (the economy), a central nervous system for coordination and long-term planning (the government), and teeth, claws, and weapons for protection (the protective force)‘Money’ is created (or selected) to allow for the circulation of resources around the economy, and also enables the coordinating body to siphon off adequate economic energy to fund its security.Governments, with their control over money, direct the resources as optimally as possible; defense, infrastructure, research, education etc. This funding of progress allows for sustainable, long-term energy production by the economy. This is a good long-term plan because maintaining control over an economic body is a long-term game.Governments also direct resources into defense. Defense is critically important because without it, the economic body can be captured by the first adversary that tries. The protection of the economic engine is of the utmost priority, because the loss of the economic engine means that the coordinating party is ‘out of power’. Historically, transitions of power are not smooth events; much economic loss occurs, which ultimately manifests as human strife. Strong defense allows the coordinating body to maintain control over the economy in the face of external threats of takeover.Defense expenditure is not designed to return economic energy back into the economic system. Defense spending expends economic energy. Funding a defensive force does not increase the strength of the economy; it is strictly a consumptive endeavor. The economic benefits of defensive funding come from the long-term strategy for maintaining long-term control over the economic engine.The Economic UnitFiat money is the value transfer tool that is created from the power of the government which makes it the only lawful legal tender of the land, and charges taxes in it. The economic engine then adopts the currency, and in doing so bestows the power of seigniorage upon the government.By leveraging the physical power of the military, the government can use this physical power to force the economy to use its declared money, and also can physically restrain people who attempt to generate counterfeit money. This makes money ‘hard’ for the people; it can’t be freely minted or produced, but ‘easy’ for the government, because they have the power to mint new money, and no one can restrain this right, because they have a monopoly on violence (power).With the power of seigniorage unlocked, governments don’t have to collect taxes 1:1 with expenditures. They can collect taxes at any given rate, and issue new coinage at any given rate. Having these two variables decoupled from each other gives more flexibility and choice in how the government chooses to leverage the currency.The freedom to issue new money is advantageous to ensuring the long-term funding of security. Economic GDP isn’t always stable; it fluctuates up and down and spikes or troughs randomly at times. The Protective Force that defends an economy would be more effective if long-term funding was guaranteed and able to be integrated in long-term plans. This makes the dependably regular issuance of new coin an optimal defense funding strategy.Discharging Monetary PowerWhen new coin is issued, new power isn’t created. It’s borrowed. Because currency is fungible, the value of newly minted coin is equal to the worth of already-existing coin.The act of minting new money does not increase the total value of all outstanding money. Rather, the existing supply of money becomes diluted, and power is drawn out of the circulating supply of money, and funneled into the newly minted coin.Minting money does not create value, it displaces it from the circulating supply into the newly minted supply. Then this new coin is allocated to fund defense, and thus the economic engine is secured from would-be attackers.Drawing power out of the monetary unit can lead to catastrophic outcomes if done in an unsustainable or inappropriate fashion; the value stored in the money is not infinite.Over time, persistent borrowing of energy becomes unsustainable, especially as the energy continually gets expended in outputs that do not efficiently recycle value back into the economic engine (e.g., the costs of the U.S. military). If the energy of the economic system is expended at a faster rate than it is produced, then the economic value of money slowly drains over time.Hyperinflation occurs when the expenditures of the Coordinating Body are so large that it enters into a state of perpetual currency issuance to fund these expenditures. This perpetual issuance generally still works, so long as the people using the money aren’t bothered by the devaluation. But, once they wake up to the rampant discharging of the monetary battery, they tend to quickly flee away from the unit.This can markedly accelerate the draining of value behind the economic unit, and lead to hyperinflation.Charging Monetary PowerThe money of an economy becomes charged by adding value to it.Someone might labor for 8 hours, and receive 100 economic units as compensation. Then, they might build a mechanism (such as a business) that achieves the same economic output, yet only costs 50 economic units to produce the same economic output. If the entire economy becomes twice as efficient, and the supply of monetary units stays the same, then the money unit has twice as much economic power behind it.Growth in economic output charges the monetary unit with economic power.If the GDP of an economy doubles and the supply of money units stays the same, the money becomes backed by twice as much economic power. The economic unit is capable of discharging double the power and thus has become charged with energy.As economies grow in efficiency, they are capable of achieving similar levels of economic outputs for less costs. The premise of sound enterprise is that a business can produce a product at less costs than any other viable alternative. If this is true, then the business is capable of receiving money, and producing products, while still having some money left over.Having money leftover after costs and expenditures means that good businesses are net-buyers of money. Economic growth means that there are more businesses competing over the same supply of money (so long as the supply of money stays the same).Money is backed by the power it bestows upon the owner. This power increases when money has more power behind it, which is a function of the size of the economy that backs the money. The magnitude of the economy behind the money is the system that produces persistent buying-pressure on money.Ultimately, the mechanism that charges or discharges the money is the act of buying or selling the unit. As good businesses are built, they bestow the power of being able to produce 1 unit of currency for less than 1 unit of cost.Economic engines run better on sound money.Economic engines don’t need money, they need power. Money is only a vehicle; it must also be backed by power. You can’t just inject money into a system if that money has no power stored within it.Take, for example, the economic engine of Venezuela, when the Coordinating Body (the government/leadership/party-in-power) attempted to make the economic engine run on money that had no power stored in it. Instead of receiving sound money, the Venezuelan economy became flooded with low-grade Venezuelan bolivars. The engine seized.Gresham's law is an observation in economics that “bad money drives out good.”If humans notice that their money is leaking value, they will try and find a different place to store their value. They will discharge the power in their money into alternative reservoirs, in order to get rid of the liability of the draining monetary units.The monetary units are sold.The mass discharging of economic units becomes critically dangerous when the coordinating governments have large economic liabilities they must fund. As the power drains from the monetary battery, the coordinating body must issue new money at a higher and higher rate in order to adequately fund the economic security and investments of the nation-state.They must issue more money, as the declining value of the money means that the money doesn’t go as far. With every new instance of issuance, the power is drained away from the supply circulating of money in the economy, and into the new supply.When humans collectively decide to not use the economic unit of a system, the resource coordination between the economy, the Coordinating Body, and the Protective Forces falls apart. Money needs to have value in order for this system to function.‘Buying’ money charges it with power. ‘Selling’ money discharges its power. Long-term net-buying bestows long-term value accrual to the money, while long-term net-selling discharges the value captured.Efficient Economic SecurityHumanity has discovered a new type of economic engine, powered by a new kind of fuel. These new crypto-economic engines are strongly suited to ensure the accrual and retention of monetary power in their native assets.These new economic engines promise to host internet-scaled economic activity, while simultaneously consuming fewer resources to host this activity. Thanks to the powers of cryptography and decentralized computing networks, securing the economic output of crypto-economic systems is highly efficient compared to the previous economic engine models that humans have developed.The fundamental innovation that crypto-economic engines bring is their ability to host economic activity with significantly reduced consumptive cost requirements placed upon its native economy, allowing the native economy to retain more of the economic power that it generates. This retention of economic power output is stored inside the money of these crypto-economic systems.Resistance to Physical PowerMuch of the efficiency leveraged by crypto-economic engines is achieved by simply not existing in the physical domain. Crypto-economic economies are hosted on the internet, and thus do not respond to physical force in the same way that Nation-State economies do. Crypto-economic systems are therefore highly resistant to physical attack; some more than others.The purely digital nature of crypto-economic systems invalidates the might of the physical powers of the world. Not having to be concerned about the strength of the US military is extremely advantageous for the economic activity being facilitated by these new crypto-economic engines.In contrast to nation-state economies, crypto-economic systems are inside their own plane of existence.Bitcoin’s Proof of Work exists in the SHA-256 world, and only responds to other SHA-256 competitors (Bitcoin Cash being the only other force-of-power in this plane, and not a very strong one).Similarly, Ethereum’s PoW only exists in the Ethash (the Ethereum consensus algorithm) plane, but will soon be migrating to Proof of Stake, in which power is defined by the value of ETH. In Proof of Stake, the only power-force that Ethereum responds to is the native asset ETH; all other sources of power are not capable of attacking Ethereum.Proof of Work, Bitcoin’s defense force, is powered by ~$5B of yearly electricity consumption and ASIC unit production.Similarly, Ethereum’s Proof of Stake system is producing a $6.6B energy-shield of economic security to its preliminary beacon chain (the future host of all Ethereum economic activity), while only costing ~$0.5B in yearly maintenance costs (economic efficiency is one of the main perks of Proof of Stake)Meanwhile, the USA spent ~$720B in 2019 to fund its military and protect its economic empire.Resistance to Human FollyCrypto-economic networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum are non-discretionary about their spending. Nation-State governments attempt to optimize expenditures across a wide variety of strategies; infrastructure, defense, education, research, etc. These strategies are attempts to accelerate growth and to produce a more productive economy.However, there are no guarantees that these endeavors pay off in the long term. Attempts to accelerate growth are investments and not all investments are wise. If the coordinating bodies of an economic system ultimately end up funding efforts that do not produce net-new economic energy, then these efforts ultimately come out of the value of the monetary unit.Too much malinvestment results in the draining of power from the money; especially if the coordinating body has committed to recurring expenditures.Nation-State coordinating bodies are forced into investing in their own future, due to the arms-race that they find themselves in. All Nation-States live in the same plane of existence, the physical world, and there is little meaningful difference between ‘defensive’ and ‘offensive’ security forces. Because of this reality, Nation-States must invest in their own future; if they don’t and an alternative nation-state power does, and succeeds; they will not be able to match this opponent in its economic-power, and therefore become susceptible to attack.With investment in the future comes risk. No one knows the future, not even Nation-States. No investment in the future is guaranteed to pay off. Because of the Nation-State arms-race competition for growth, the long-term prosperity of these economic systems becomes a function of human leadership and effective coordination. Long-term health of nation-state economies is tied to ability and power of collective human brains.Sometimes, humans mess things up.Crypto-economic systems, on the other hand, are solely focused on powering defense, and nothing else. Baked into the values of crypto-economic systems is the goal of establishing strong economic foundations, and letting the economy grow under its own power.Crypto-economic systems protect the economic engines, but they do not tinker or manipulate them.Crypto-economic systems are not led by a collection of human brains; they are powered by numbers and algorithms. Crypto-economic systems do not make subjective investments or bets on the future. They do one thing, and one thing only: provide economic security.This constraint on the scope of crypto-economic systems is theorized to produce better social-scalability. No longer do the economic actors on these platforms need to place their trust in the competence of human leadership; instead they have assurances about the long-term operation of these systems, as these systems have automated away the need for human coordination, and replaced centralized leadership with code and math.A Revolution in EconomicsCrypto-economic systems are orders of magnitude more economically efficient compared to Nation-States.The net result of reduced security costs and eliminated debt financing is significantly reduced power draw from the economic engine to fund security.Because of these cost reductions in system maintenance, more monetary power is redirected back into the value of these crypto-economic monetary units. Crypto-economic systems do not issue new coin as a function of the size of the economies they control. Instead, when these crypto-economies grow larger, the cryptocurrency assets that power these systems grow in value instead of supply.This is advantageous for the economic actors that transact on these systems; less of human productive output needs to be taxed to fund public economic security. If the economic system costs less to maintain, those that produce the economic output on which the engine runs are better equipped to retain the full value of their economic labor.Crypto-economics are extortion-minimized economic systems, which is a compelling feature for the economic actors of the world.The Crypto-Economic Design SpaceWe are in the era of crypto-economics. Crypto-bulls believe improvements offered by crypto-economic engines offer a natural basin that will slowly attract the economic activity of Planet Earth. Economic activity is simply more efficient when using crypto-economic engines, and people desire efficiency in their economic engagements.Yet, not all crypto-economic engines offer comparable levels of efficiency.Proof of Work is InefficientBitcoin built the first viable crypto-economic engine, and has proven viability as a construction.A critique of the Bitcoin system is that it is using ‘stone-age economics’. Bitcoin is an attempt to produce an economic system in which the money is most similar to Gold. ‘Gold 2.0’ is a frequent term used to describe the Bitcoin system.It’s important to remember that ‘Gold 2.0’ is only describing one side of the Bitcoin system; the monetary unit. The other component of economic systems is the engine itself. BTC is the fuel, Bitcoin is the engine.The Bitcoin economic system is an attempt to re-create a tried-and-true economic model for its money: perfect scarcity of the money. While gold is constantly being dug up from the Earth and added into the circulating supply of gold, we know from the laws of physics that there is a finite supply of gold found on Earth. Because we know this, gold acts as a sound monetary battery because it cannot be freely minted by anyone.There is a fundamental breakdown, however, between the comparison between BTC and Gold. Gold achieves its security through a deep connection to physics. Nothing in the universe can create gold other than an exploding star. Gold is secured by the energy of a supernova. After the energy in an exploding star is released, all gold has been minted from this event and no more. All economic costs to maintain the security of gold is paid for at genesis. There are no ongoing costs to secure the value of gold; it gets its security for free.Bitcoin, unfortunately, does not have this feature. Bitcoin has ongoing costs for maintaining economic security:Perpetual energy consumptionPerpetual ASIC degradation and turnoverBitcoin Proof-of-Work operates through an endless competition to mine Bitcoin blocks faster than everyone else. Those that produce more hashes mine more blocks, and receive more rewards.This PoW competition perpetually gets more and more fierce as the value of BTC goes up. The incentive to participate in the ‘consensus engine’ of a crypto-economic system is a function of the value of the unit that is being competed for. If there is value being issued to fund security, there will be interested parties willing to compete for that value. If there is more value being issued, then there will be more people in competition.Under Proof-of-Work, this endless competition to mine Bitcoin blocks adds security to the Bitcoin system, at the cost of expending the energy inside the BTC monetary unit. As the margins for PoW miners get slimmer and slimmer, more and more BTC must be sold to pay for the operational costs. Selling the unit discharges the energy, and Bitcoin security is fundamentally designed to instigate a race to consume as much energy as possible.Bitcoin is secured by long-term perpetual selling pressure on the economic unit.The GDP of the Bitcoin economy generates the economic fees for making a transaction in the Bitcoin crypto-economic system, and these fees are sent to the miners and sold to fund the mining operation.This is a constant drain on the BTC monetary unit. Bitcoin’s security is persistently funded by BTC sell-pressure from miners. While the 21 Million BTC supply cap makes BTC an attractive place to store one’s wealth, it comes with a secret hidden tax of miner sell-pressure to fund the security of the system.As described above, monetary units are charged by buying and discharged by selling.  The net outcome of this design is that the value of Bitcoin’s native economy won’t be able to be fully expressed by BTC the asset.BTC the asset leaks its value due to significant power-draw placed on it by the Bitcoin Proof-of-Work security engine. Bitcoin’s expenditure-based security is persistent, reliable long term sell pressure of BTC from PoW miners, because Bitcoin does not meter resource consumption by its security providers.Just as economic systems before it, Bitcoin is secured by taxation on GDP produced by its economic engine. Bitcoin’s military, its PoW force-shield is running at an extremely high burn rate.Security Through Transaction Fees is InefficientA second inefficiency in the Bitcoin economic engine is its inability to control its security budget.Bitcoin’s long-term security comes from the transaction fees paid to the network. Those transaction fees are paid by those who want to make a transaction on Bitcoin, and the fee for including your transaction in the ledger is paid to the Bitcoin miners.Bitcoin does not know how much fees it will receive at any given moment; it just collects the revenue it receives and sends all of it to the miners. Bitcoin has no capacity to give long-term assurances to its security providers about the future size of the security budget. As stated above, the GDP of economies fluctuate and spike, and Bitcoin’s security budget is a function of economic exchange on top of Bitcoin.BTC fees paid to miners are volatile. Sometimes they are low, sometimes they are high. This is like injecting fuel into an engine by stomping on the gas and then immediately releasing it. Rather than finding the exact right spot to go the desired speed, Bitcoin just throws all of its received transactional revenue into the engine as soon as it receives it.Not being able to meter the economic resources inputted into the Bitcoin security engine means two things:Bitcoin miners have an unpredictable security budgetBitcoin is overpaying for securityGiving up the power of issuance at the protocol level means that Bitcoin’s security acts as a sail, powered by the winds of its economic engine. It is not actually capable of generating its own power; its security is a function of its own economy. Bitcoin’s native economy may be enough to keep the sail filled with air, but long-term security assurances are absent.Additionally, because Bitcoin directs 100% of all received transaction fee revenue towards miners, it never gives itself the opportunity to pocket excess revenue to save for a rainy day. If the Bitcoin economy is running hot, Bitcoin forwards all of this revenue directly to the miners, instead of taking those economic excesses and saving them for later.Bitcoin doesn’t manage a balance sheet; all economic excesses end up getting paid to the Bitcoin miners, who are perpetually in a race to increase their energy consumption.In Nation-State economics, central banks raise and lower interest rates as economies heat-up or cool-down. Lowering interest rates means that the central bank is capturing less economic fees, and promoting economic activity. Increasing interest rates means that the economy is heating up, and it’s safe to charge more in transaction fees to pocket this revenue, in case this reserve is needed in the future.Bitcoin sheds this entire notion, and simply lets the free market determine the transaction fees, based on demand to transact on Bitcoin, and then directs 100% of these fees to the PoW miners.Not having the option to pocket these fees and save them for later is the forfeiting of an extremely powerful value-capture mechanism, and leads to less soundness in BTC over time.Ethereum’s Advances in Crypto-EconomicsBitcoin has been obsessed with optimizing very specific parts of its crypto-economic system.BTC the asset is prioritized above all other components. Bitcoin is designed to preserve the 21 Million hard cap supply of BTC, and everything else is a means to produce this end.From the perspective of a holistic, integrated system design of both an economic engine and monetary fuel, Bitcoin has sacrificed the efficiency of its engine to produce scarcity in the asset.But crypto-economic systems are composed systems; the aggregate output of these things are the result of the interaction between the power of the money and the efficiency of the engine. Optimizing for one and not the other leaves you with an inefficient system that is a drag on the economy that it hosts.As with all technological innovations that humans have ever come up with, there have been 12 years of crypto-economic research and development to leverage.Leveraging these advances in crypto-economics means that we can move away from the stone-age economics of ‘Gold 2.0’, and move into the full expression of sci-fi economics using optimizations in both cryptography and digital economies.Proof of Stake is Efficient SecurityProof of Stake is an alternative to Proof of Work that leverages the value of the native asset of a crypto-economic system to provide security to the economy.Bitcoin Proof-of-Work secures itself via a competition in resource consumption, and forces potential attackers to match and surpass the rate of economic consumption to attack the network.Ethereum Proof-of-Stake secures the system by erecting a ‘wall-of-value’ that a potential attacker must overcome in order to attack the system.Currently, there is 3,618,200 ETH ($6.7B) staked to the Ethereum beacon chain (the early foundation for Ethereum 2.0). An attacker must stake an equivalent amount of value to attack Ethereum, denominated in ETH. If an interested party wants to attack Ethereum, they will need to source 3,618,200 ETH in order to do so. $6.7B of buying pressure on ETH the asset is likely to significantly increase the price of ETH, so the US-Dollar value of Ethereum security is actually likely much higher.What’s more important, however, is that Proof of Stake systems do not consume economic resources. All that is needed to secure Ethereum under PoS is a Raspberry Pi, an internet connection, and 32 ETH.Stakers are not required to sell their ETH rewards to pay for the economic costs of providing security. The ‘economic costs’ of Ethereum are the opportunity costs of holding ETH.Proof of Stake operates on the assumption that there is a sufficient supply of interested parties who will hold ETH in order to access ETH-denominated rewards.Naturally, the disposition of people who are particularly suited to do this are those who are bullish ETH. People who are bullish ETH always want more and more ETH. These people will both purchase ETH off the secondary market in order to stake it, and keep the ETH dividends that they receive.The juxtaposition between Proof of Work and Proof of Stake couldn’t be clearer. PoW generates a rat-race of energy consumption that leads to long-term persistent selling of the asset by miners. PoS surgically targets the party of people who are most bullish on the asset, and provides them with a transaction validation system that allows them to not have to sell any ETH to express their belief in the growth of the Ethereum economy.PoW miners fight to more efficiently produce hashes for Bitcoin, in the hopes that their efficiencies mean that they have to sell less BTC than their competition. PoS validators compete in their bullishness on ETH, by pricing out lesser-bulls out of ETH rewards.Those who are fundamentally the most bullish on ETH the asset are also those that are willing to accept the least amount of ETH rewards as compensation for locking up their capital in ETH to stake to Ethereum.Proof of Stake rewards increase or decrease as a function of the supply of ETH being staked to Ethereum. If there is less ETH staked, ETH rewards are higher and vice versa. As more and more validators stake ETH to Ethereum, the ETH-denominated rewards are reduced. This process will wash out the lesser-ETH bulls who are less interested in reduced rewards, leaving those who are willing to receive the least amount of ETH possible.Through this mechanism, Ethereum organically discovers the optimal balance between Ethereum security and ETH issuance.This mechanism leverages control-theory to optimize for sufficient Ethereum security, while maximally retaining ETH scarcity.Additionally, this mechanism tilts the axis of power towards those who are the most bullish on the economic asset that powers the Ethereum economy: ETH. ETH holders are the individuals who are most interested in Ethereum’s health and success, and Ethereum perpetually rewards these individuals with the asset they love the most: ETH.This is how Proof of Stake erects the highest walls around its economy, while specifically compensating the party of people who are the most inclined to uphold the network, for the cheapest cost.As a result of this mechanism, Ethereum needs to issue the least amount of new currency to provide adequate security for Ethereum.Once Proof of Stake is adopted and the Proof of Work system is forked away, yearly ETH issuance drops from ~4.75M ETH (4.1% of outstanding supply; 2,372,500 blocks/year, 2 ETH/block), to a projected 0.6-1M ~0.5-1% issuance (staked ETH projected between 10M and 30M).Capturing Economic Excesses: EIP1559EIP1559 is a mechanism for capturing the economic excesses of the Ethereum economy, and funneling these excesses back into the value of ETH.EIP1559 formally links the economic power behind the Ethereum economy with the value of the ETH currency.BASEFEE is paid by economic actors on Ethereum to get a transaction included on the Ethereum ledger. The size of BASEFEE is determined by the demand to get a transaction included. If there is significant demand to transact on Ethereum, BASEFEE moves upwards.BASEFEE operates as a governor over Ethereum’s economy. If the economy gets hot, BASEFEE increases; if Ethereum’s economy cools down, BASEFEE decreases.BASEFEE is burnt.Unlike Bitcoin and other non-EIP1559 crypto-economic systems, Ethereum’s transaction fees aren’t paid to those that provided security. They are simply removed from supply, effectively returning the value of the burned units back into the remainder of the circulating supply.This is the exact opposite of issuance, where the minting of new coin is borrowing monetary power from the circulating supply. EIP1559 makes the flow of power go in reverse: value flows from the excesses of the economic engine into the economic unit.All systems generate heat loss, but EIP1559 is a heat-recycling mechanism that recaptures Ethereum’s economic excesses.BASEFEE is the crypto-economic analogue to Central Bank interest rates; it goes up when the economy heats up, and it falls when the economy cools down. It adds value back to the balance sheet of the holistic economic system.This is restoring power back to the economic unit. BASEFEE is a persistent buyer of ETH. It is a ‘stock buy-back’ of company equity. It is the central bank charging interest rates, to add strength to the currency. Every single transaction on the Ethereum economy is adding power into its monetary asset, ETH.This mechanism benefits all ETH holders equally, as all ETH holders have a higher percentage of remaining ETH supply. As a monetary unit, EIP1559 makes ETH a more compelling money to hold.EIP1559 is a mechanism that associates economic output to economic unit scarcity. ETH gets more scarce as Ethereum’s economy produces economic output. As we discussed above, sound money is money that tracks the economic output of an economy.Growth in the economic output of an economy charges the monetary unit with economic power. If the GDP of an economy doubles, and the supply of money stays the same, the power-output of money should have also doubled.With EIP1559 and the burning of BASEFEE, the supply of ETH reduces as a function of the growth of the Ethereum economy.This is the new paradigm specifically enabled by crypto-economics. This is the difference between trying to recreate ‘stone-age’ economics (gold 2.0), and the creation of something brand new, using new tools.Sound money is money that grows in scarcity as a function of the growth in the size of the economy that uses it. But what is money that receives outsized tailwinds from economic growth?Importantly, the more power lies behind ETH the asset, the less ETH is needed to be issued to fund economic security, as one economic unit of ETH goes further as a reward for providing security.The rate at which BASEFEE will burn ETH won’t truly be known until it is implemented; test-nets and economic models only go so far. But the Ethereum researchers estimate that BASEFEE will burn 50-70% of Ethereum’s current fees (50-70% estimation from a conversation with Ethereum core devs).There are reasons as to why EIP1559 doesn’t burn 100%.According to CoinMetrics, the 200-day moving average for ETH fees paid to Ethereum is ~10k ETH per day (March 2021).If EIP1559 were to be implemented right now, the yearly ETH burn rate would be projected to be about 2.2M ETH (60% burn rate, 10k ETH paid in daily fees).The ETH burn rate is strongly correlated to the total economic activity that is hosted on Ethereum. Ethereum fees have never found any sort of equilibrium; there is no ‘normal’ fee level. Future fee magnitude is highly unpredictable.Critics of Ethereum will point towards Ethereum’s current state of highly speculative, yield-chasing, gambling-esque behavior and claim that Ethereum fees are only sustained by a greater-fools game.Those bullish on Ethereum will rattle off a seemingly endless list of possible economic activities that Ethereum is uniquely suited for, as mechanisms for long-term sustainable fee demand.To discern between these two ends of the spectrum, I’ll ask the reader to review the above sections discussing the power that efficient crypto-economic engines provide to the economic transactors who leverage the platform:“The economic activity hosted on Ethereum’s native DeFi ecosystem is better equipped to retain the full value of the labor put behind it.”Ultra Sound Money 🔊🦇Ultra Sound Money refers to the compounding synergies created from EIP1559 and Proof of Stake.EIP1559 puts perpetual buy-pressure on ETH from the fee revenue it generates from its native economy. In contrast to the federal reserve being the ‘lender of last resort’ for the USD, Ethereum is the ‘primary buyer’ of its own native currency, and it uses all of its excess revenues to buy-and-burn ETH from the circulating supply.Simultaneously, Proof of Stake inherently rewards the smallest viable cohort of ETH bulls who are willing to accept the least amount of ETH rewards possible while providing adequate Ethereum security.The power of these components are multiplicative. They are a function of each other; a recursive relationship between the power behind one function feeding into the others.With Proof of Stake, yearly ETH issuance is under 1% (~25% ETH staked). ETH issuance drops from 4.75M ETH per year (4.5% monetary base inflation) to between 0.5M ETH and 1.2M ETH per year (~0.5-1% monetary base inflation).With EIP1559, yearly ETH burn is at 1.9%, an estimated ~1M ETH will be burnt in fees (at current fee markets, assuming 60% fee burn).All of these factors feed into each other and make each other stronger, creating a positive feedback loop into the value of ETH.This positive feedback loop is furthered by the fact that ETH is the most trustless asset on Ethereum. As the native asset on Ethereum, ETH has favorable risk parameters as collateral on DeFi. There is no matching ETH’s level of trustlessness, as all other assets on Ethereum were issued by humans (who are folly) or code (which can be buggy).We can see this in applications like MakerDAO, Aave, or Compound, who give favorable interest rates and collateralization ratios to ETH collateral, enabling ETH capital to be more efficient than alternative assets.We also see this in applications like Uniswap or Sushiswap, where ETH is the dominant trading asset. Total Uniswap liquidity is $5B as of March 2021, and ETH represents $2.1B of this total supply of liquidity. The second most liquid asset on Uniswap is USDC, sitting at $350M.We also see this in applications like RAI, which attempts to make a self-referential, governance-eliminated, non-USD stable collateral, which logically can only use ETH to back it, due to the design-goal of eliminating human governance.ETH’s privileged position as pristine collateral in DeFi applications will add to the scarcity tailwinds to the supply of ETH; an additional source of power that feeds into the monetary energy behind ETH.The 12 years of crypto-economic advances made since the introduction of Bitcoin in 2009 are coming to a head with Ethereum and Ether. With the integration of EIP1559 and Proof of Stake, along with a native economic layer on the internet, Ether is will be the most economically optimized asset that humanity has ever come up with.A new era of economic efficiency and monetary soundness will be unlocked, and will assist humans everywhere to more effectively achieve their economic goals and aspirations.With the Ultra Sound Money putting power into our engine, a new age of human coordination and flourishing is upon us!Should we say it one more time?ETH is ultra sound money 🔊🦇Action stepsUnderstand the core concepts behind sound money and economic enginesConsider the case for ETH as ultra sound moneyListen to Ultra Sound Money | Justin Drake",https://www.bankless.com/ultra-sound-money-,2021-03-24T00:00:00.000Z,"https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/image/fetch/w_1200,h_600,c_limit,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https-3a-2f-2fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com-2fpublic-2fimages-2f669fd6bc-178e-45eb-9c64-d724430e8e4f_550x500.jpg",David Hoffman,Bankless,blog,,Unknown Error

They think they can still get away with stuff like this: They think we need them. They’re wrong. A $200 billion Coinbase would be bigger than Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, and Blackrock…and it’d be closing in on the market cap of Bank of America. Zoom out for a minute…a 9-year old crypto company that’s already bigger than the banks. How crazy is that? The banks can’t ignore a publicly traded Coinbase above $100B. The FinTechs they could handle. The FinTechs built on banking rails. But these crypto banks are building on open, permissionless money networks. They’re cutting banks out of the value stream.

Bad for the Banks. It’s finally here…it’s Coinbase Week. - David and RSA","Dear Bankless Nation,On Wednesday Coinbase’s stock ($COIN) will be publicly listed on the NASDAQ.This is a landmark event for crypto.The is the first crypto-native company to list on U.S. public markets. This listing gives traditional investors pure exposure to the crypto industry in a way a) they can understand and b) they can easily buy.With COIN, you don’t have to be smart enough to know which crypto assets will dominate in the future, you’re buying exposure to an exchange that sells them all.Forget the gold rush…this is upside in a company selling the picks and shovels.Better yet, Coinbase released Q1 results ahead of its listing and it’s a MONSTER.Q1 2021 volume hit $335B (that’s over 1.7x all 2020’s volume in one quarter!🤯).Active users jumped from 2.8 million in Q4 to 6.1 million in Q1 2021.Cash machine cranking with $1.8B in Q1 revenue and $800 million in profit.The Coinbase FTX implied valuation ahead of the direct listing has been marching upwards for all of 2021 and is now valued at $136 billion.For more valuation metrics check out this page from The BlockHere’s our take about what’s about to happen on Wednesday:Our current crypto thesis (and shared by many) is that we are in a late-stage fiat credit cycle. Money is cheap. There’s a ton of cash looking for places to go, and this is partly why crypto assets have outperformed basically everything since March 2020.It doesn’t matter what valuation COIN takes on day one. It’s going to pump.$100b valuation? It pumps.$200b valuation? It pumps.$300b valuation? It still pumps.If we are truly in a late-stage fiat credit cycle, then it won’t matter what Coinbase’s valuation is. Coinbase operates the largest toll-road from the world of fiat to the crypto Ark that can save investors from perpetual devaluation.People will pay the toll to use that road.So now let’s talk about what this means for three groups: DeFi, CeFi, and the Banks.What does this mean for DeFi?The UNI Coinbase trade has been the talk of DeFi since mid-late 2020.The rationale? If a first generation crypto exchange is worth $100b, what’s the value of a DeFi exchange that’s now regularly surpassing Coinbase volume and already has 13x the trading pairs of the entire NYSE?UNI has hit a new All-Time-High today—maybe it’s because everyone knows it’s Coinbase Week.UNI isn’t the only token showing a lot of energy today either.SUSHI is up 14% and ZRX is at an ATH of 4 years in the making.The other obvious take is that attention on Coinbase is going to put further attention on crypto-assets at large. But perhaps more specifically, the assets on Coinbase that aren’t Bitcoin. Of the 55 assets that are on Coinbase, 39 of them are tokens on Ethereum, and the rest are L1 currencies (BTC, BCH, LTC, EOS, DOT, etc)When you look beyond Bitcoin, you find DeFi.Following in the footsteps on the NFT movement, Coinbase could be a vehicle that blasts the DeFi conversation open for a broader population.That means more capital into DeFi tokens…but it also means more DeFi users.Today there’s maybe 1.8m unique Ethereum addresses using DeFi…assuming every  user has 4 addresses…that means there’s less than 500k DeFi users.Meanwhile Coinbase has 100x more users than DeFi—over 56 million registered users. 😱How many of these will start their DeFi journey after joining Coinbase?If BTC is the gateway drug to ETH, maybe Coinbase is the gateway drug to DeFi.This is good for DeFi.What does this mean for CeFi?UNI isn’t the only asset feeling the Coinbase Week energy.BNB, the pseudo-equity token for Binance, had a killer quarter up almost 20x which has massively outperformed most DeFi tokens and ETH so far in 2021.Technically, Binance is already ‘public’ if you think the BNB asset is the true equity of Binance (we’re not sure we do), and it would make sense that a Coinbase listing would have positive downstream effects. Binance is the offshore, unregulated correlate to the U.S. domiciled, highly regulated Coinbase…and it even has its own Ethereum simulator chain!A publicly traded Coinbase is good for FTX—it opens the U.S. and they didn’t buy a Miami stadium for nothing. It’s good for Gemini—when Gemini IPO Cameron and Tyler?? (and will you issue a token airdrop)? It’s good for Kraken—this is the legitimacy the industry needs to turn crypto banks into actual banks.Will Coinbase and the crypto banks start getting invited to important banker meetings like this one last year?Public Coinbase gets the crypto banks closer to a seat at the table with the big boys.This is good for CeFi.What does this mean for the Banks?Zzzzzzz….the banks have been sleeping on crypto. They’ve never had a real challenger. They think their privileged position protects them from competition.They think they can still get away with stuff like this:They think we need them.They’re wrong.A $200 billion Coinbase would be bigger than Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, and Blackrock…and it’d be closing in on the market cap of Bank of America.Zoom out for a minute…a 9-year old crypto company that’s already bigger than the banks.

This is why it’s increasingly the case that people don’t view Punks and Glyphs as merely tradable NFTs. Instead, more and more folks are starting to see these particular NFTs as digital artifacts with major cultural significance. Why? Because they’re memetically charged with trailblazing and masterful execution atop a young Ethereum, which may go down as one of humanity’s greatest achievements in the 21st century, and this memetic charge — and the demand it’s producing — is growing. For example, consider that one CryptoPunk is now worth more than one bitcoin as of this week, or that a group of Punks are being sold at prolific mainstream auction house Christie’s next month. As for Autoglyphs, the current Glyph price floor on OpenSea is 90 ETH! So it’s certainly safe to say Larva Labs’s work is commanding unprecedented levels of interest. That’s why many NFT users snapped to attention last week when Kevin Rose, a partner at True Ventures and the host of Modern Finance , tweeted out that he was amazed by a preview of a new Larva Labs NFT project. That’s all we have to go on for now, which isn’t much, but knowing Larva Labs and their impressive legacy we don’t need much to start getting seriously excited. Indeed, even with scant info it’s no stretch to say that this project’s release and ensuing activity would be poised to be the seminal NFT happening of 2021 if it is, in fact, released this year. In the meantime we can only speculate and, like Kevin Rose suggested, prepare our ETH. So the takeaway here is this: the 3rd Larva Labs NFT project is as compelling as any you could track on your personal radar in the days and weeks ahead.

That’s why many NFT users snapped to attention last week when Kevin Rose, a partner at True Ventures and the host of Modern Finance, tweeted out that he was amazed by a preview of a new Larva Labs NFT project.That’s all we have to go on for now, which isn’t much, but knowing Larva Labs and their impressive legacy we don’t need much to start getting seriously excited.Indeed, even with scant info it’s no stretch to say that this project’s release and ensuing activity would be poised to be the seminal NFT happening of 2021 if it is, in fact, released this year.In the meantime we can only speculate and, like Kevin Rose suggested, prepare our ETH. So the takeaway here is this: the 3rd Larva Labs NFT project is as compelling as any you could track on your personal radar in the days and weeks ahead. If we know anything, it’s that tons of fun and possibilities await!Action steps☑️ Head to the Larva Labs Twitter account and turn on post notifications so you can stay up to date on all the team’s announcements.",https://www.bankless.com/an-nft-juggernaut-approaches,2021-04-27T00:00:00.000Z,"https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/image/fetch/w_1200,h_600,c_limit,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https-3a-2f-2fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com-2fpublic-2fimages-2f230ddcd0-98f4-4428-81f0-462f2fbe63a9_748x748.jpg",William M.

However, we can already see the cracks in Web2 apps like Twitter, Facebook, and Google products. These legacy corps suffer from a fundamental misalignment of incentives among the different parties that use their services. Web2 social networks started off as paradigm-shifting platforms that allowed humans from all over the world to come together and share experiences in culture. And then, the companies that owned these platforms turned from growth to extraction , as shareholder incentives take over. If the platform is free, you’re the product . This is Facebook causing civil wars in far-off countries by selling eyeballs to the highest bidders. This is Twitter de-platforming a president ( for better or worse ). This is all of the Web2 companies having equity trading on U.S. domiciled exchanges, while the equity of the company governs a globally scaled social platform, essentially becoming an appendage of American Imperialism. Nic Carter, in his article Your Property Rights Should Extend to Social Media, argues the case for “Squatters Rights” over social media accounts. Nic argues that: It’s the users of these Web 2 platforms that create the value. According to each Web 2 platform’s “Bill of Rights” (ToC’s), users do not own the property that they settle on (Twitter handles, YouTube accounts, Facebook pages). Web 2 platforms have unregulated and misaligned governance practices over the real estate where their users settle. Users are likely to migrate to more ‘politically stable’ platforms in which their property rights as account-owners have stronger assurances. Select excerpts: Facebook, Twitter, et al, did not really create all the content on their platforms, nor do they really own it. Instead, they define a namespace that users occupy, build upon, and in some cases commercialize. The users, not the administrators, create the vast majority of the value, and as such are the rightful owners of their digital property. …squatters asserting their property rights against an authority that lays a blanket claim to them would be nothing new. That’s the legal struggle that defined the history of the American continent. Initially, large tracts of land were claimed primarily by the states and absentee landowners. Over time, squatters were able to argue persuasively they had put sufficient labor into their homesteads to legally ratify their informal claims “…it’s clear the current largest internet platforms are taking an unsustainable approach to digital governance.” We can expect that if the major platforms continue to operate as unaccountable fiefdoms, users will gravitate towards systems that are more politically stable, those that enumerate and define the rights of users (rather than just listing, Ten Commandments-style, various bannable offenses), and enshrine genuine protections of property. This is why we need organizations that are built by users, and why it’s particularly revolutionary that DOs are formed by individuals coming together under a shared goal of producing something that the group wants collectively . This bottom-up organization allows for the bottom to dictate the direction of the platform. Because DOs are comprised of individuals who opt-in, rather than VC-funded leadership, the resulting product is aligned with the vision of the collective rather than the entrepreneurialism of a few select visionaries. Eventually, DOs will be able to fulfill similar niches that Web2 platforms currently fill. However, these solutions will be user-built, user-governed, and user-directed. They will have a DO token that ensures that those stewarding the DO are aligned with the org, and the token will both fund progress and capture energy from the system in order to sustain itself. By the very nature of their organization, DOs will be constructed in such a way that enables their uses to achieve success, rather than extract capital from their users on behalf of the shareholders. At maturity, DOs should be platforms and organizations that assist humanity, rather than extract from it. Because the DO is building a product that is fundamentally aligned with its users, the product will come to enable its users, as technology should! Technology is just a bicycle for the mind, after all. It should assist us in moving towards our individual and collective goals.","Dear Bankless Nation,The 9 to 5 is dead.The days of “going to the office” are over.We live in the internet age. The world has gone digital—the pandemic accelerated it. People want to work where and how they want.But the digital economy isn’t optimized for top-down organizations. How do you measure contribution? Where’s the HR department? The corporation is a bad fit for an open and permissionless digital world.Instead, the future of lie’s within Digital Organizations (DOs). These are the cousins of DAOs, still digital, but not fully autonomous. Rather than relying strictly on code, DOs rely on humans and tokens to coordinate.These are bottom-up and emergent coordination tools.This is the future of work.David explains in today’s piece.- RSATHOUGHT THURSDAYBankless Writer: David Hoffman, Co-Founder of BanklessThe Future of WorkWhere there is value, there is opportunity, and where there is opportunity, there is demand for labor to help capture that opportunity.The magnitude of opportunity found inside of the crypto industry dwarfs everything else in the world. Therefore, there is also an insane demand for talent and labor, unlike anywhere else.The massive expansion of value and capital in this industry over the last 12 years has outpaced what the people of this Earth can keep up with. Not everyone can uproot their lives and dive into a young, high-risk, high-volatility industry. At large, global populations take years or decades to slowly pivot towards solutions for a labor glut. Even traditional, meat-space instantiated companies like Coinbase can’t even capture the entirety of this opportunity, because this opportunity is inherently internet-native.Only internet-native organizations can fully access the opportunity brought by an internet-native revolution in money and finance. As the total value of crypto-wealth grows, the demand for crypto-labor follows.This crypto-labor is going to be serviced by Digital Organizations.Digital Organizations Are The FutureThe future of work belongs to Digital Organizations. Colloquially, we call these DAOs, but that is not the right label for what are actually Digital Organizations.The OG concept of a DAO, a Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is code at the center, and humans at the periphery. A DAO is a smart-contract or system of smart-contracts on Ethereum that are autonomous because they have no human dependencies; they operate as autonomous software on Ethereum. Uniswap, AMM’s, and RAI are good examples fit the original definition of what a DAO was.DAO’s were theorized to eventually become increasingly complex:“What if we could just turn Uber into a smart contract, and all the Uber drivers would work for the DAO, and be able to keep a larger share of their profits??”Comments like this were commonly found in the early days of Ethereum, from 2015-2017, before most people had to grapple with the immense complexity of changing the state of meat-space using Ethereum, which is exclusively a virtual state machine.The OG version of a DAO is a land of infinite possibilities, and I predict that these meat-space-changing autonomous systems are where Ethereum ultimately arrives in 2040+, once Ethereum’s ability to organize humanity has matured to be more effective than Nation-State and jurisdictional organizational schemas.We’ll revisit DAOs in a few decades, but now is not the time for DAOs.Now, it’s time for DOs.Digital Organizations are the next frontier of Ethereum and the future of work.WoW Guilds and raids, or any other MMORPG group, should already feel familiar with Digital Organizations, especially when considering World of Warcraft as an economic landscape filled with scarce treasure and resources.Digital Organizations are compositions of humans without geographic constraints. Largely hosted in Discord servers (but not exclusively!), DOs are collections of like-minded people with like-minded goals, that work together to make progress towards those goals.DOs tend to form organically, where those most resonant with the goals and aspirations of the org increasingly gravitate to the Discord server and community.And now, with Ethereum, DO’s have access to a new tool that changes DOs from communities of intrinsically motivated communities to financially motivated organizations.That tool is the token.Tokens power communities.Tokens are the thing that turns passive Discord channels into active ones. Tokens are the fuel that DAO laborers consume in order to output value for the org. They provide and catalyze the motivational energy for the DO to do.The token represents the reservoir to which DO community members can deposit their time and labor into. Members of the DO inherently want the DO’s token; if they don’t want the token, then they probably wouldn’t be in the DO’s Discord server. The desire to own a larger share of the DO is what injects labor into the DO, and helps make it become a valuable thing to own in the first place.The DO, as the controlling entity of its own token, has the power to mint/issue/award tokens to the members that labor for the DO, and if there is a sufficient supply of interested labor willing to work for DO tokens, then the DO has the available potential energy to progress towards its desired goals.DOs (Bankless DAO still calls itself a DAO) are their own Leviathan. The shared goals and culture form the organization, and token rewards are the incentive to keep the organization cohered and progressing towards their shared goals.In Thomas Hobbes Leviathan, he claims that Nations compose themselves with force. Threats of jail or bodily harm is why you don’t steal, why you pay taxes, and why you drive on the right side of the road.DO’s have no such power; they compose themselves by the power of postive incentives, and incentives alone. I’ve poorly photoshopped out the sword out of the hand of the Bankless DAO Leviathan, because it doesn’t have one. In lieu of violence, Bankless DAO provides BANK for participants, and all DAO members are in the org by opt-in incentives alone.Instantiating Purpose and GoalsTokens are the instantiation of shared purpose and shared goals. Each DO grows its own social contract and its own culture, and it revels in these things as it works towards building a future that the DO wants to see for itself. The token becomes a totem of the community as the representative symbol of everything the DO stands for.It becomes the banner which the DO’s army stands behind.This allows people who resonate with the collective goals and purpose of the DO to work for something that they intrinsically believe in, enabling people to work for a calling, not just a job or career.Above, I said: if there is a sufficient supply of interested labor willing to work for DO tokens, then the DO has the available potential energy to progress towards its desired goals.Whether or not a DO has the available potential energy to achieve its goals is highly correlated with what that DO has set out to achieve.“Even a billion dollars of capital cannot compete with a project having a soul.”

Vitalik, Endnotes on 2020: Crypto and BeyondHaving a soul is to have purpose and meaning in the world. Unlike any organizational structure ever before, DO’s have the power to coalesce people all over the world under common goals and aspirations, that are based in intrinsic desires rather than extrinsic profit motives.One of the core components of the Ultra Sound Money model, and Eric Wall’s Proof of Stake is Less Wasteful article, is that Proof of Stake is the optimal form of crypto economic security is because it organically selects those who are most bullish to provide security. ETH bulls are willing to accept the least amount of token issuance, in order to provide ample amounts of stake to the system. Those most aligned with Ethereum do the most work for it, for the least cost.This same effect happens with DOs. People join DOs because they are intrinsically aligned with the goals, aspirations, and culture of the DO. These people find themselves wanting to contribute, rather than being compelled to contribute. These people will work for the DO for the least cost, because they intrinsically believe in what they are doing, and they also want the DO tokens more than anyone else.DOs are strictly opt-in systems, and the only people providing labor to the DO are the people that intrinsically want to be there.Imagine, for example, a young DO with a brand new token that has low-to-no market cap and very little liquidity in its token. This DO wants to build a relatively ambitious website. The DO can either:Find a website agencySource talent from inside the DOBecause the DO is brand new, it doesn’t have any capital. It only has its own token, which is low market cap and low liquidity. Imagine how difficult it would be to convince a 3rd party website agency to build a website for the DO, while accepting compensation in the DO’s illiquid token.If the website agency isn’t intrinsically interested in exposure to upside of the DO, it’s going to be a hard sell, and they’re likely going to want an outsized amount of DO tokens to offset the risk of providing labor for an organization that may not work out.On the other hand, if the DO is working towards something that people intrinsically believe in, the people interested in seeing that vision achieved will naturally find themselves gravitating towards the DO, and are also willing to help the DO get what it wants. They might work for the DO for free, in order to win social capital (aka Kudos) from the other DO members and rise the ranks of DO social clout. Maybe they’re also willing to gamble that the DO will award them tokens for their labor in the future, and by showing their commitments to the DO, they will be in a good position to receive future compensation.Maybe these incentives land with enough talented web developers and project managers that the DO can get its website built from this talent pool.DOs are vehicles for accessing labor from talent that is aligned with the vision and ethos of the DO, and represents a vehicle for building organizations that are highly aligned with human values.DOs have the capacity to generate a shared vision of the future in its members. The more that that vision is Good, as defined by the people of the world, the more talent and labor that DO is able to attract. Some human values and cultures are more ubiquitous and salient than others, and DOs that can align with these strong human values have the power to tap into a lot of aligned labor interested in proliferating these values.DOs are vehicles for building progressive organizations that are fundamentally aligned with human values, and what we want to see the world become.Bullish on Humanity 🚀New Limits to ScaleInternet-native organizations have the ability to align incentives at an internet-scale.

“…it’s clear the current largest internet platforms are taking an unsustainable approach to digital governance.”

We can expect that if the major platforms continue to operate as unaccountable fiefdoms, users will gravitate towards systems that are more politically stable, those that enumerate and define the rights of users (rather than just listing, Ten Commandments-style, various bannable offenses), and enshrine genuine protections of property.This is why we need organizations that are built by users, and why it’s particularly revolutionary that DOs are formed by individuals coming together under a shared goal of producing something that the group wants collectively.This bottom-up organization allows for the bottom to dictate the direction of the platform.

Technology is just a bicycle for the mind, after all.It should assist us in moving towards our individual and collective goals.Changing Work CultureDiscord and Slack have a ton of similarities. They’re basically group coordination software that allows work streams to stay focused and organized, enabling asynchronous coordination between people. You don’t have to be perpetually present; things can progress without you being there, and you can tune into them as you’re ready to, and get caught up to speed.Different Slack/Discord channels are spun up for different work streams, and the fluidity of movement between channels allows for work streams to come together as needed, in case there is a product being made that combines separate work-teams.But the main difference between Discord and Slack is that Discord is more open. Discord is just inside-out Slack. There’s something about the culture of Discord that promotes openness and access. Slack culture is very much top-down. It’s very corporate. Discord culture is very bottom-up. It’s emergent.Here’s the state of the BanklessDAO discord, just 1 week after birth:For younger generations, Crypto Culture is product market fit. For the internet natives, Discord DO’s are blurring the line between labor and play. Work is occurring in the same places people recreate. Everyone is proximate to both progress and relaxation.DO members are leading the WFH lifestyle, where not only do they not have offices, but they also don’t have 9-to-5 labor hours. Like the 24/7 crypto-markets, DAOs are perpetually in a state of ‘On’, but the working members are fluidly turning themselves on and off as it fits inside of their lifestyle. In the legacy world, you prioritize work before life, and you mold your life so that you can hold a job and work.In DOs, lifestyle determines labor, rather than labor determining lifestyle.DO’s are going to offer an experiment in both establishing a new paradigm in work culture, and also an exploration into what it means to be productive. It’s common knowledge that anyone in a corporate, 9-5, office-job works for about 2-3 hours per day, and then spends 5 hours being “busy”, waiting for 5pm to strike so they can go home.The crypto industry has a habit of stripping away the BS from things, in order to get right down to the essence of the matter. People who work for DOs are already home, so there’s no such thing as idle hands under work-hours. There aren’t any hours ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. DO’s find creative and innovative ways to compensate for output rather than regular hours.This is the work-life culture that Millenials and Zoomers dream of. Working in the comfort of one’s own home, online, and no-or-little top-down authority ensuring active labor. Compensation on contributions, with minimal commitments.Not only do the legacy institutions of the world have to compete with the permissionless labor-monetization tools offered by Ethereum, but they also have to compete with the lifestyle that these tools offer: the freedom to work for oneself.Fluid WorkUnlike typical employment, DO’s don’t make you sign employment contracts and become exclusively committed to them. DO members are free to fluidly move between DOs, contributing their skills wherever they fit.Rather than rigid, vertical corporate structures, DO work could resemble a flat mesh network of organizations. Interestingly, it’s likely that many DOs will share a significant amount of the same members, as the people who are good at DOing will likely find themselves working for multiple DOs.If you are a young person, looking for purpose, meaning, and eventually a salary, establishing yourself as a strong DOer is one of the best footholds you can establish for yourself. DOs are so new, and are in need of leadership. That can be you, and you can make a name for yourself by rising the ranks of DOs by being a good DOer. If you believe DOs are the future, you should start DOing now, so that you become the scarce resource for both DOs and people who need help DOing.The Future of Work in an AI worldOne of my pre-crypto fascinations was the coming AI-driven world, which was largely informed by these two books:Life 3.0 - Max TegmarkHomo Deus - Yuval Noah HaraiBoth books largely come to similar conclusions with regards to the relationship between AI, humans, and labor.Tl;DR:The point of technology is to reduce the need for human labor. Progressing as a society is we find ways to automate all the stuff that we don’t want to do, that we need to do anyways or else we die.Taking this to its logical conclusion, humans are going to produce generalized AI, and that AI can truly do every single task we ever need to, in order to survive.This is utopic, because we have robots doing all our work!But it’s way more dystopic, because economically, a high percentage of the population won’t be able to fund their own life because there is no work left.In this world, we will need to recreate the market for specifically human labor, and that’s what DOs can do for us. DO’s have the opportunity to redirect this dystopic future into a more positive one, by capturing the supply of available human capital and directing it into cultural outputs.The whole point of existing in this world is to produce culture, and the elimination of low-value work (burger flipping etc) can be a boon to cultural creation.There are going to be some things/products/services that humans are going to specifically want from other humans. These products and services are going to be immune from advancements in AI, because these products are going to be produced by humans because other humans demand them to be human-produced. I believe that DOs are largely going to be cultural generation facilities, and DO competition will ultimately converge upon which DO can create the best culture for its contributors, creators, members, and consumers?MetaFactory has this figured out. MetaFactory is leading the way into expressing crypto-culture via merch and has its finger on the pulse about the value of cultural expression.Bankless DAO is also a culture DO, focusing on establishing and perpetuating Bankless Culture throughout the world.Culture-as-a-product can only be made by humans, to be consumed by humans. The future of work will be focused on cultural creation, and it will be funded by an insatiable desire to purchase culture. DO and Do work can be a sanctuary for human capital, immune from the advances of cultureless AI.You may think: “Apparel? NFTs? Blogs? AI can produce all that stuff? They can produce culture just as well as humans can! The whole point of AI is their outputs are indistinguishable from human outputs.” And this is a good critique.But there are already signs of people wanting products in the world that are made by humans, even when the robot-created version is equally as good. Hand-made goods always go for a premium. People simply pay more for human labor, and over time I expect DOs to focus in on products that humans want to be produced by other humans.ConclusionWe are about to embark upon a great crusade! DO’s will help us do more than ever before! There is great potential in the vision articulated above, if it ever comes to fruition.It may not.Maybe DOs just don’t have what it takes. Maybe it’s too ambitious to hope for emergently organizing systems without top-down control.But if it does happen, it’s going to happen because people are going to help others figure out what it means to DO. What does it mean to be a good DOer? What work and labor do DOs need the most? How can DOs fairly compensate people, when rent needs to be paid and families need to be taken care of? How do we ensure different parts of different DOs are fairly, but differently, compensated?We need to find the answers to these questions, and these answers are going to come from collaborative experiments. Like with all things, it’s going to be an iterative process of discovering what works and what doesn’t.If you want to participate in, or even just observe, these experiments playing out in real time, you need to be a part of Bankless DAO.Bankless DAO is bootstrapping itself from a relatively blank-slate into a self-sustaining organization with self-selected goals and aspirations, and self-oriented directions to achieve those goals. It’s truly an experiment like none-other in the space, and if it works out, it can a model for many more DOs to follow.If the goals and values of Bankless DAO aren’t for you, then don’t worry. Eventually there will be a DO for everyone! It’s just a matter of time until anyone with any particular interests has a relevant DO to align with, just like how there’s a subreddit for every hobby or a Facebook group for every interest.We’re on the frontier of DOing.Just DO it.Action stepsExplore the future of work with Digital OrganizationsJoin the Bankless DAO!",https://www.bankless.com/the-future-of-work,2021-06-03T00:00:00.000Z,"https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/image/fetch/w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https-3a-2f-2fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com-2fpublic-2fimages-2f455fe542-4576-4828-93ad-8bba46848716_636x750.jpg",David Hoffman,Bankless,blog,,Unknown Error

The Sushi developer team has been working concertedly in recent months to expand Sushi’s offerings into wider domains, like margin trading and NFT trading. In this article, we’ll explore all the services Sushi’s currently offering to users. Swaps/pool system The bread and butter of Sushi is its AMM, which allows anyone to swap and provide liquidity for the long tail of token pairs. To swap your crypto assets or serve as an LP, just head over to Sushi’s Swap page and thumb between the “Swap” or “Liquidity” interface as needed. You can search for desired tokens via this interface by searching for them by name or by pasting in their token contract address into the provided search bar. Sushi’s Swap interface. SushiBar SushiBar is Sushi’s profit-sharing system. You stake SUSHI through SushiBar, and you receive xSUSHI in return, which grants you the right to start earning a cut of all the swap fees accrued throughout the entire Sushi ecosystem, i.e. across multiple blockchain implementations. The other benefit of xSUSHI and SushiBar is that it directly affords holders Sushi governance rights, so you don’t have to “unstake” your SUSHI as is the case with several other DeFi tokens in order to vote on project’s governance proposals. Onsen One of Sushi’s early strategies is to serve as a hub for long-tail asset trading (i.e. “selling low volumes of hard-to-find items to many customers”). To accomplish this, Sushi incentivizes many smaller trading pairs. This is where the Onsen program comes in. Onsen is a liquidity bootstrapping service provided to new DeFi projects. It gives such projects the ability to accelerate their on-hand liquidity by offering $SUSHI rewards to participants. In this way, new projects don’t have to heavily incentivize users with their own native governance token; instead, they can lean on Onsen to incentivize these same users with $SUSHI. The net result? Sushi gets more liquidity, and young projects get the early liquidity they need to survive. 🤪 Fun Fact: Bankless DAO’s $BANK token was recently added to Sushiswap’s Onsen!","Dear Bankless Nation,Sushiswap started out as a fork of Uniswap V2, and launched with a relatively controversial approach.The anon dev team used what’s called a vampire attack, where the protocol heavily incentivized existing Uniswap LPs to migrate their liquidity to Sushiswap using the SUSHI token as a reward.This was before Uniswap launched its own UNI token. An intense battle ensued over the next few weeks as the protocols fought over liquidity, and ultimately forced Uniswap (a project that took a strong stance on not needing a native token) to launch UNI.There was another issue as well. The anon founder, Chef Nomi, rug pulled the Sushiswap ‘developer fund’, and took off with ~$10M worth of ETH from the protocol. He later returned the money, but his reputation was damaged. He hasn’t been seen much since.The good thing is that Sushiswap has evolved well beyond its rocky origin story as a Uniswap fork. They’ve actually become one of the most successful DeFi protocols to date with billions of dollars in liquidity, one of the top DEXs in terms of daily volume, and generating a significant amount of revenue for xSUSHI holders.They’ve also launched an expanded product suite including lending, token launchpads, NFT exchanges, cross-chain implementations, and more.So we had William take some time to research everything that’s going on with Sushiswap.Let’s dig in.- LucasP.S. Ledger just launched their Paraswap integration—allows you to swap tokens at the best price directly from your Ledger Live app. Idk might be worth using Paraswap….P.P.S.

The interesting part is that the Sushi developer team has expanded to a suite of decentralized products well beyond its flagship DEX protocol.This Bankless tactic will help you familiarize yourself with all of Sushi’s current offerings so you can make the most of this project’s various services!Goal: Learn what Sushi currently has to offerSkill: IntermediateEffort: Varies, depending on which product/s you tryROI: APYs in the triple-digits if you partake in Sushi’s ongoing yield farmsA Sushiswap PrimerSushi is an automated market maker-styled (AMM) decentralized exchange (DEX) that launched in August 2020, right toward the end of the first and now crypto-legendary DeFi Summer.A fork of Uniswap V2, Sushi quickly gained traction last year with how it competed with Uniswap. The Sushi team used a “vampire attack” in order to win over liquidity from Uniswap by offering liquidity providers (LPs) enticing $SUSHI rewards.Not long after this vampire attack began, Sushi founder Chef Nomi ran off with over $10M worth of the Sushi project’s ETH. He later returned it. Nomi was quickly ostracized from the project, and the Sushi team started its second life, with a new captain at the helm: talented dev 0xMaki, by building out the original Sushi AMM into what it is today: a multi-faceted DeFi suite of financial products.The State of the SushiSo how is Sushi faring these days? Pretty good, if you dive into the numbers!DeFi Pulse highlights that Sushi currently has +$2.75B in total value locked (TVL) on Ethereum and up to $3.8B if you factor in Sushi’s multi-chain implementations (e.g. Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, etc.). This makes Sushi one of the top 10 most used dApps in all of crypto.Token Terminal also indicates that Sushi is pulling in millions of dollars worth of revenue on a daily basis. Not bad for a DEX that hasn’t even had its first birthday yet, right!Sushi revenue data provided by Token Terminal. Sushi’s products and offeringsAs mentioned, Sushi isn’t just an AMM anymore. The Sushi developer team has been working concertedly in recent months to expand Sushi’s offerings into wider domains, like margin trading and NFT trading.In this article, we’ll explore all the services Sushi’s currently offering to users.Swaps/pool systemThe bread and butter of Sushi is its AMM, which allows anyone to swap and provide liquidity for the long tail of token pairs. To swap your crypto assets or serve as an LP, just head over to Sushi’s Swap page and thumb between the “Swap” or “Liquidity” interface as needed.You can search for desired tokens via this interface by searching for them by name or by pasting in their token contract address into the provided search bar.Sushi’s Swap interface. SushiBarSushiBar is Sushi’s profit-sharing system. You stake SUSHI through SushiBar, and you receive xSUSHI in return, which grants you the right to start earning a cut of all the swap fees accrued throughout the entire Sushi ecosystem, i.e. across multiple blockchain implementations.The other benefit of xSUSHI and SushiBar is that it directly affords holders Sushi governance rights, so you don’t have to “unstake” your SUSHI as is the case with several other DeFi tokens in order to vote on project’s governance proposals.OnsenOne of Sushi’s early strategies is to serve as a hub for long-tail asset trading (i.e. “selling low volumes of hard-to-find items to many customers”).To accomplish this, Sushi incentivizes many smaller trading pairs. This is where the Onsen program comes in. Onsen is a liquidity bootstrapping service provided to new DeFi projects. It gives such projects the ability to accelerate their on-hand liquidity by offering $SUSHI rewards to participants.In this way, new projects don’t have to heavily incentivize users with their own native governance token; instead, they can lean on Onsen to incentivize these same users with $SUSHI. The net result? Sushi gets more liquidity, and young projects get the early liquidity they need to survive.🤪 Fun Fact: Bankless DAO’s $BANK token was recently added to Sushiswap’s Onsen!BentoBoxBentoBox is a DeFi vault system that pools funds around the Sushi ecosystem. You supply assets, Sushi puts them to work in DeFi, and the rest takes care of itself.That said, BentoBox is still being built out, so we don’t know the full picture regarding how the BentoBox will work. What we do know is that the liquidity pooled up in the BentoBox can be used in other Sushi apps, so the more robust the liquidity, the more options that are available.BentoBox is relatively new, but expect Sushi to build more products atop it.KashiKashi, which means lending in Japanese, is the first app built atop the BentoBox system. The lending service lets users create and customize their own decentralized borrowing and lending markets, with each of these markets isolated from one another.As the Sushi team explains in their docs:“Kashi’s unique design enables a new kind of lending and borrowing. The ability to isolate risks in individual lending markets means that Kashi can permit users to add any token. In addition, isolating the risks of the different lending markets enables users to achieve leverage in one click, without ever leaving the platform.”MisoAnother service Sushi released earlier this year was MISO, i.e. Minimal Initial Sushi Offering. The product is centered around facilitating streamlined token genesis events (TGE) through the Sushi platform via crowd sales, batch sales, and Dutch-styled auctions.The code involves a native TokenFactory, escrow capabilities, yield farms, and more.Examples of tokens released through Miso so far include SAK3, FOLD, VOL, IBY, and more. ShoyuLast week in Metaversal, I published a write-up on Sushi’s coming NFT exchange and launchpad. The project, dubbed Shoyu, is being built as a suite of tools that are catered to Web3 artists and collectors.What’s interesting is that Shoyu (and also all of Sushi’s other offerings) will generate fee revenues for xSUSHI holders over time. So if you’re big on Shoyu’s NFT potential, holding xSUSHI is a natural next step!Multi-chain deploymentsThe days where DeFi builders solely deploy to Ethereum are dwindling. This doesn’t strictly mean that Ethereum is losing out, it just means that developers are looking to expand the surface area of their product suite. It’s a natural move for many.Now there are multiple DeFi blockchains with Ethereum acting as a central hub for these chains, so the Sushi team is acting accordingly by taking an “all of the above” approach to liquidity.In other words, Sushi’s already deployed its AMM to multiple chains like xDAI, BSC, Fantom, Moonbeam, and more. Wherever there’s DeFi, Sushi’s going. They want to be a hub for liquidity on any chain. So if you’re interested in trying out these cross-chain implementations, your best bet is to add these networks to your MetaMask wallet and to dive in from there.That said, for people who are mainly comfortable with Ethereum, the best Sushi cross-chain option to use right now is Polygon, as Polygon’s sidechain has been explicitly designed to cater to Ethereum users. So navigate to Sushi, switch to the Polygon network, and enjoy fast and cheap trades.Then you can transfer your assets back to Ethereum as you wish!ConclusionSushi may have started out as a fork of Uniswap V2, but the project has evolved into a new DeFi beast altogether.Of course, it’s ultimately up to you to decide which dapps you want to use. Yet what makes Sushi particularly compelling is that it’s not only one of DeFi’s top exchanges, it’s also branching out into new DeFi and NFT territories via products like Kashi and Shoyu.Accordingly, Sushi may compete with other DEXes when it comes to AMM trading, but no other DEXes can compete with the expanded products and services that Sushi’s team has put out and is continuing to put out. Sushi’s in a league of its own in this regard, which is why the project’s making a name for itself these days!Action steps🍣 Try any of Sushi’s products by going to sushi.com Level up with other Bankless resources on Sushi: The Case for $100 SUSHIParticipate in the Bankless DAO MetaFactory Drop!",https://www.bankless.com/how-to-use-sushiswap,2021-06-22T00:00:00.000Z,"https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/image/fetch/w_1200,h_600,c_limit,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https-3a-2f-2fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com-2fpublic-2fimages-2fdd8206cf-d4fe-47dd-aa95-14da467104bf_1600x900.jpg",William M.

Governance is still also highly centralized and the protocol has struggled with low voter turnout. That being said, Perpetual Protocol seems to be an incredibly promising project. The protocol has an innovative design, strong token economics and value accrual mechanisms, explosive growth that indicates product-market fit, dominant competitive positioning in a growing vertical, and a potentially undervalued token. Importantly, it has the numbers to back all of this up. Could PERP emerge from a potential bear market as a future DeFi blue chip? Up to you to decide.

Ready to dive into PERP? 😍Every time we write something on DeFi perpetuals we feel compelled to remind you…Perpetuals are the largest derivatives product in crypto….by far.So this market is massive.The question…why aren’t they dominant in DeFi yet?It seems the market is telling us decentralized derivatives protocols don’t yet stack up. Centralized exchanges (aka crypto banks) are still winning by a wide margin.But we don’t think that lead will last. We believe DeFi protocols will eventually flippen centralized exchanges on all fronts—derivatives included.Today Ben dives into one of the DeFi projects leading those efforts right now for perpetuals: Perpetual Protocol.This incredible analysis answers one key question: is PERP undervalued?Read on to find out.- RSAAn Overview Of Perpetual Protocol and PERPNOTHING IN THIS ARTICLE IS FINANCIAL OR INVESTMENT ADVICE. DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH.The noise has washed away. A post-crash, range-bound market has led to a dramatic decline in trading volumes, DeFi activity, and social media chatter from its peak in May 2021.Whether it’s due to bearishness, boredom, or enjoying summer in a reopening world, it feels like people have tuned out of crypto again. 🦀And even though some people have their eyes off the ball, there’s still a plethora of DeFi protocols with tremendous potential for growth and strong fundamentals. No area is more emblematic of this than the derivatives sector. Despite the notional value of derivatives estimated to be worth a staggering $1 quadrillion in TradFi, it’s been a different story in DeFi (so far).It’s hard to pinpoint the exact reason—whether it’s inherent complexity, high gas-fees, or other factors, derivatives have yet to truly take off.But there has been one notable exception to that rule...Perpetual Protocol.A decentralized exchange for trading perpetual contracts, crypto’s most popular derivatives product, Perpetual Protocol has quickly emerged as the market leader in this category since launching in December 2020.Perpetual Protocol DeFi perp market share dominating since early Q1 (source)Is PERP poised to become one of the next bear market gems?Let’s find out.Perpetuals 101Before we dive into the protocol, let's take a moment to go over what perpetuals are.Perpetual contracts are a type of derivative instrument that are similar to futures. For those who may not know, futures contracts are an agreement between two parties to exchange an asset, or the cash equivalent of that asset, at a predetermined time, known as the expiration date.👀 Fun Fact: Perpetuals are crypto native, as they were invented by Bitmex!To initiate a futures contract, both parties will have to post collateral that is held by a counterparty. From there, a trader can gain leveraged exposure to an asset in order to speculate on its price, or hedge their portfolio. This can all be done without having to take custody of the underlying asset itself if the futures contract is cash settled.Where perpetual swaps differ from traditional futures is that they have no expiration date (hence the name).This characteristic is a key reason as to why perpetuals have found product market-fit within the crypto ecosystem, as not having to deal with an expiring contract makes them more accessible and easier to manage for retail traders than traditional futures.However, the lack of an expiration date comes with tradeoffs. With traditional futures, the closer a contract gets to expiring, the more its price will converge upon the spot price of the underlying asset. For perpetuals to be able to keep the price of the derivative as close as possible to that of the underlying asset, market participants must pay what is known as the funding payment.Funding payments are made at predetermined intervals set by the exchange, such as hourly on FTX and Perpetual Protocol, with the size of the payment known as the funding rate.🤓 To see how funding rates are calculated on Perpetual Protocol, click here.Depending on the price of the contract, either longs or shorts will make funding payments to each other. For instance, if the price of the derivative exceeds the value of the underlying asset, to incentivize traders to bring its price down, longs will have to make funding payments to shorts. The opposite holds true if the price trades below the spot value of the underlying asset, where in that case shorts would have to pay longs.What is Perpetual Protocol?Now that we understand what perpetuals are, we can dive into the protocol itself.Perpetual Protocol enables users to trade perpetual contracts with up to 10x leverage entirely on-chain. Transactions are processed on xDai, an EVM-compatible chain, meaning that the protocol can offer lightning fast transaction speeds with minimal gas fees.In fact, fees on xDai are so low that the protocol subsidizes gas for MetaMask users.This strategy has allowed Perpetual Protocol to quickly find product-market fit, with trading volumes sitting at around $60M per day, making it the largest derivatives DEX and placing it within the top 10 in the world.Traditionally, AMMs have only been able to support spot trading (i.e. swapping one token for another). However, Perpetual Protocol enables derivatives trading on an AMM through the use of synthetic assets, or “virtual assets”, which makes both shorting and leverage possible.How Perpetual Protocol WorksWhen a market is created on Perpetual Protocol, the developers will manually set the liquidity (the x and y) for it based on past experience. The protocol's liquidity is virtual, as the “x’s and y’s” are just numbers stored inside an AMM, which is why the team has named Perpetual Protocol’s AMM the virtual AMM (vAMM).Whenever a trader wants to open a position in a market, he needs to send USDC to what's known as the Clearing House. The Clearing House will apply the direction (long or short) and the leverage to the collateral (the USDC), and then use the x*y=k formula inside a vAMM to calculate how much a trader should get in return. In other words, Perpetual Protocol only uses vAMMs to calculate the price of the virtual assets, as opposed to facilitating the exchange of real tokens.Let’s walk through an example to see how this works.Let's assume the price of ETH is trading at 2,000 USDC when we launch the ETH perpetual market. The developers can then manually set the x (the number of vUSDC) in the vAMM to 200K and y (the number of vETH) in this vAMM to 100. As previously mentioned, the liquidity inside a vAMM is virtual as in both of the x and y are numbers.Let’s say a trader named Alice wants to use 100 USDC as collateral to open a 10x long position.Alice would first deposit 100 USDC to the Vault, a smart contract that stores the real tokens inside the Perpetual Protocol system. Following this, the Clearing House will apply the direction (long) and the leverage (10x) to the collateral, and then use the vAMM to calculate how much the trader can get in return. In Alice’s case, the x increased by 1,000 vUSDC, and y decreased by 0.4975 vETH, so the latter is how much Alice gets in return.To learn more about what will happen if there are multiple traders, and the math behind each transaction, check out Perpetual Protocols documentation.🧠 Note: The above explanation only applies to the current version of Perpetual Protocol as the next iteration is still under development. Perpetual Protocol v2 will be on Arbitrum and introduce new features such as multi-collateral, cross-margin, and permissionless market creation. You can check the announcement here.PERP Token EconomicsNow that we understand the Perpetual Protocol, we can dive into its token.While used for governance, PERP is far from “valueless” or static. Rather, it plays a key role within the Perpetual Protocol ecosystem, and has clear value accrual mechanisms.Aside from governing, the primary utility of PERP centers around its ability to be staked within the protocol. This turns the token into a productive asset, as holders who stake can earn streams of income in the form of PERP rewards, and in the future, once the protocol enters “Stage 2” of staking, a portion of trading fees generated by the exchange. Despite only paying out token rewards at this time, stakers can still earn a yield that currently sits at 34.3% APR.Currently, Perpetual Protocol charges a 0.10% fee on every trade made in the vAMM, with 100% of fees going towards an insurance fund that is used as a backstop the protocol in the event that positions become under-collateralized, and bad debt is unable to be liquidated.Once “Stage 2” goes live, 50% of fees, or 0.05% of volumes, will be distributed to stakers in a dividend type-manner similar to SushiSwap, Curve, or Synthetix. Furthermore, once V2 goes live, PERP holders will be able to earn additional trading fees from user-created “private markets,” as well as lending interest through deploying capital from the insurance fund into low-risk yield strategies.Supply & Demand Dynamics Of PERP StakingDiving deeper into the mechanics of staking, we can see that it plays a key role in influencing the supply and demand dynamics of PERP in a way that’s favorable for its price.For starters, it has taken a considerable portion of supply off the open market, as over 21 million tokens, about 50% of the current circulating supply, is staked. This not only increases the scarcity of PERP, but also can help to blunt sell pressure during periods of market volatility, as holders who wish to un-stake their tokens are forced to wait through a seven day “cooldown period” until their assets become liquid.We may have seen the efficacy of this mechanism during the May 19th crash, as PERP finished the day down 6.5%, compared to a 31.6% decline in the DeFi Pulse Index (DPI).In addition, the way in which PERP rewards are distributed is also favorable for its price. As we know, token incentives are a double edged sword: While effective in directing capital to a protocol's desired destination, they can place downward pressure on price, as rewards are often harvested and sold by yield farmers.Perpetual Protocol helps to mitigate this through vesting. While trading fees paid out to stakers are liquid, token rewards vest over the course of six months.This can be incredibly effective at reducing sell pressure, as it means fewer tokens are being dumped into the market. For instance, if fee capture was active last week, of the 150,000 PERP distributed to stakers, just 24% was liquid, i.e. able to be instantly sold.From that, we can see that this rewards structure provides Perpetual Protocol with the best of both worlds in that it can reduce short-term sell pressure on PERP, while still being able to provide an attractive enough opportunity to incentivize stakers. Furthermore, it also encourages long-term holders to stake their tokens, as they likely have less of a need for immediate liquidity on their token rewards compared to mercenary farmers.Protocol BackstopDespite providing cash flows and favorable supply and demand dynamics, tokenholders still bear a considerable amount of inflation risk. That’s because like MakerDAO’s MKR, PERP acts as a backstop to protect the solvency of the protocol. Should the insurance fund be depleted, PERP functions as the “token of last resort” in that it will be minted by the protocol to re-collateralize the system.While this provides an incentive for Perpetual Protocol to continually drive value to the token, such as through the mechanisms above, to keep that backstop as large as possible, it also means that holders run the risk of facing significant dilution should catastrophe strike.Governance and CommunityHaving an active and engaged governance process and community is vital to the success of any DeFi project, particularly one in its youth like Perpetual Protocol.Post-launch, Perpetual Protocol has been very actively managed, with 16 governance proposals having been put to vote on Snapshot since January 2021. On average, about 532,000 tokens have voted per proposal, which accounts for 1.2% of the current circulating supply, and roughly 3.5% of the circulating supply at the time the protocol went live on mainnet.While it is a problem that plagues DeFi as a whole, this is a low level of turnout.Furthermore, the level of governance participation among the community has dropped over time, as the first eight proposals garnered about an average of 618,000 votes, while this has declined more than 30% to ~427,000 over the last eight.It’s also important to note that governance of the protocol is not yet fully decentralized, as proposals still have to be implemented on-chain by the team. In addition, control over the protocol is also heavily concentrated, as 40.2% of the token supply is controlled by the team and investors. Aside from being a centralizing force, this may pose a regulatory risk to the protocol, particularly as derivatives, such as those offered by Binance, have come under scrutiny in recent weeks.Despite these concerns, Perpetual Protocol has an incredibly strong ecosystem of stakeholders. The project was backed by a top-tier group of investors, including firms such as Three Arrows Capital, Alameda Research, Multicoin Capital, and CMS Holdings. In addition, the protocol also partnered with Delphi Digital for its token design.Whether it be through usage of the protocol, partnerships, or general advice, this cohort is likely to be a key factor in helping put the protocol and the community in a strong position to succeed.On-Chain Valuation MetricsPerpetual Protocol has plenty of promise: But has it lived up to the hype in practice?Taking a look at some on-chain metrics, we can see that the protocol has shown strong signs of finding product-market-fit within DeFi.Volumes and RevenuesPerpetual Protocol has experienced explosive growth since its launch in December 2021, facilitating over $20.6 billion in cumulative trading volume in roughly eight months.Source: Token TerminalAs revenue corresponds directly to volumes given that the protocol earns a 0.1% fee on every trade, it experienced a similarly meteoric trajectory, with $20.6 million in fees being directed to the insurance fund. Had the 50/50 split been in effect, this would have translated to $10.3 million in earnings for PERP stakers.Source: Token TerminalLooking into the composition of volumes, we can see that the perpetuals generating the highest amount of fees, and therefore revenue, have been the ETH/USDC, BTC/USDC, and COMP/USDC which have done $4.9 billion, $2.2 billion, and $1.3 billion respectively. Together, the three account for over 40% of the protocol's cumulative volume and revenues.Perpetual Protocol's growth is even more impressive when considering that it’s managed to facilitate this level of trading activity while requiring minimal levels of liquidity, as it currently holds just $10.1 million in value locked. This indicates that the vAMM model is highly capital efficient, and that fees and revenue are generated from the notional value of the derivatives within the vAMM.Source: Token TerminalDiving deeper, we can see that monthly volumes grew at an astounding 10,939% rate from $77.9 million in December 2020 to $8.6 billion in May 2021, while the crypto markets were in the midst of a major bull-run and trading activity increased across both CeFi and DeFi, this growth wildly outpaced that of the broader spot DEX market, which rose “just” 523% over that same time-frame.This far above-average growth is a strong indicator that Perpetual Protocol’s ascent can be attributed to organic demand to use its product, and can not just be attributed to a “rising tide that lifts all boats.”Source: Dune AnalyticsHowever, the past few months have told a different story, as volumes have decreased dramatically since peaking during the crash of May 19. The 28-day rolling average of daily volume has fallen 69.9% from its high of $303.4 million to $91.4 million, reaching as low as $45 million on some days.While a drastic descent, it is also in-line with that of the broader market, as overall DEX volumes are on pace to fall over 60% as well between May and July 2021. Although the decline in trading on Perpetual Protocol has not come out of nowhere, it does illustrate that the protocols volumes, and thus revenues, are highly correlated to market and DeFi activity.UsersAmid the recent bull run, Perpetual Protocol saw strong user growth. Monthly active users (MAUs) increased dramatically between December 2020 and May 2021, rising 471% from 153 to 874, and over 2200 traders have interacted with the protocol since inception.This is validation that Perpetual Protocols strategy of leveraging xDai has been a success, as it came during a period that saw other projects' user growth plateau due to high gas-fees on Ethereum L1. In addition, the growth also occurred while the exchange is not currently eligible for use by traders in the United States, likely due to the previously mentioned regulatory concerns.Source: Dune AnalyticsHowever, like volumes and fees, user counts have fallen similarly in recent months, with the 7-day moving average of traders declining 47% from 359 to 196.Source: Dune AnalyticsDespite that decline, there are still some encouraging numbers when it comes to user metrics. For starters, Perpetual Protocol has not seen any decline in the amount of whales using the platform, with the count of addresses that have traded over $100 million in volume increasing since the crash from 23 to 24.Source: Dune AnalyticsIn addition to retaining whales, Perpetual Protocol has also seen less concentration of volume among them, with the top-5 addresses accounting for 38.5% of volume, down considerably from its May peak of 71.4%.Source: Dune AnalyticsThis user-stickiness indicates that the decline in trading volumes, and therefore revenue, is linked more to the general slowdown in market activity in recent months, rather than an organic decrease in demand to use the platform from users.Market ShareDespite its status as a relatively new protocol, Perpetual Protocol has quickly gained a dominant share over the DeFi perpetuals market.At the peak of market activity in May 2021, the protocol had 70% share of the $12.2 billion in monthly volumes facilitated between themselves, dYdX, and Futureswap—the two other major DeFi perpetuals exchanges which did 18% and 12% of volume, respectively.Source: Token TerminalWhile it's unclear what happened to the data for Futureswap in July of 2021, Perpetual Protocol has managed to widen the gap between themselves and dYdX, doing more than 7x in volumes so far in July 2021, compared to 3.9x in May.Perpetual Protocol’s increased share over dYdX may be attributable to a few different factors. A primary one may be that gas-free trading has increased accessibility of using the protocol: As we know, gas fees, particularly with computationally intensive derivatives transactions, can price out smaller users.Despite its early lead, competition from dYdX is not likely to go anywhere. The project has embraced a strategy similar to Perpetual Protocol by leveraging the power of Layer 2 by building their own rollup on Starkware, allowing dYdX to also offer gasless trading.This, along with a massive $65 million Series B funding round raised in June 2021, means that Perpetual Protocol is likely to face formidable competition for the foreseeable future. Lastly, the ability to overtake dYdX in such a quick-time frame suggests that the DeFi derivatives market is still highly unsettled, and subject to rapid, major shake-ups in the competitive landscape, which Perpetual Protocol may itself fall victim to.Intrinsic ValuationNow that we understand Perpetual Protocol, the token economics, and how the project has performed since launch, we can try and determine the intrinsic value of PERP using a Discounted Cash Flow Model (DCF). While growth estimates are very difficult to estimate for a months old project in an incredibly volatile DeFi market, it can help establish a rough estimate as to what the token may be worth.This model should be taken with a grain of salt, and uses conservative estimates. But by doing some basic projections, we can see that it’s possible PERP is actually highly undervalued.Source: Me!To play around with the model, as well as relative valuation metrics, yourself, click hereAssumptionsThe model assumes that the protocol will maintain its fee capture rate of 0.10%, and that revenue will increase about 9.38x over five years, but at a decelerating rate. (The number for 2021 was taken from annualized revenue based on the past 30-days).It should be noted that due to the reflexivity in DeFi and cyclicality of crypto, there is a good chance growth decreases in some years, but rapidly increases in others. However, it is very hard to project when that will occur, so we will assume volumes increase each year, but at a slower rate.While this may seem aggressive, growth like this is not unprecedented. It could wind up being conservative, as DEX volumes have grown more than 30x since June 2020, while centralized exchange volumes grew over 40x between June 2017 and June 2021.To reflect the high level of returns that investors require to match the massive risk that they take on by investing in an early-stage DeFi protocol, a discount rate of 40% was chosen which is within the range used by venture capitalists. In addition, a terminal growth rate of 2%, a figure in-line with that of traditional global GDP growth, was also chosen.ValuationAs we can see, by these parameters PERP has an intrinsic value of $25.53 per token, with a valuation (FDV) of $1.11 billion. Given that token trades at a price of $6.29, and a market-cap of $273 million, this suggests it could have 305% upside if it traded to its estimated intrinsic value.Again, this model is for illustrative purposes only, it is NOT an end all, be all. There are major assumptions made. That being said, it does show that Perpetual Protocol may be highly undervalued relative to its long-run growth potential.Relative ValuationNow that we have a basis for PERP’s intrinsic valuation, let’s see how it’s valued relative to its peers. Because dYdX does not currently have a token (but soon?), and Futureswap does not have available data beyond June 2021, we’ll compare it to other decentralized exchanges with similar fee-capture models.Price-Volume (PV)For any decentralized exchange, volumes are the key fundamental metric to look at. If there’s no volume, there’s no revenue. And if there’s no protocol revenue, well…As we can see, Perpetual Protocol trades closely in line with SushiSwap and Curve, while Synthetix trades at a significant premium. This suggests that either Synthetix is overvalued, or the market may not view Perpetual Protocol, and the others, as having as strong an ability to maintain or increase their current level of fee capture.Price-Earnings (PE) and Price-Earnings-Growth (PEG)While Perpetual Protocol does not stand-out as undervalued on a P/S basis, the story is a bit different when looking at Price-Earnings (P/E).As we can see, the protocol is trading at the cheapest multiple relative to its peers, valued inline with fellow derivatives exchange Synthetix, while trading slightly below SushiSwap and significantly below Curve. While a low P/E could mean that PERP is a bargain, it can also be a sign that the market does not view its competitive positioning or growth prospects as favorably.However, a closer look does suggest that PERP may be genuinely undervalued compared to its peers.That’s because relative to its growth, PERP is trading at a tremendous discount. We can see this by looking at the Price-Earnings-Growth (PEG) ratio, which is calculated by dividing an asset's PE by its earnings growth rate. Perpetual Protocol has a PEG of 0.1, meaning that despite having a growth rate more than 10x that of its closest peer, Curve, investors are paying 51x less per unit of growth for the former than they are for the latter.This is not to say Curve is overvalued, but instead it may indicate that the market is significantly discounting Perpetual Protocols incredible growth.Risk FactorsAny crypto-asset, particularly DeFi tokens, carry tremendous amounts of risk. Let’s reiterate the major ones specific to Perpetual Protocol that we have touched on throughout the piece.1. Under-collateralization & Smart Contract RiskThe solvency of the Perpetual Protocol system is dependent on under-collateralized positions being able to be liquidated. While the insurance fund and the ability to mint PERP are mechanisms used to backstop the protocol, the possibility always exists that not all bad debt is able to be liquidated.And of course, there is always the risk of a catastrophic smart contract bug or exploit that results in the loss of user funds.2. Slowdown In Crypto Trading and DeFi ActivityPerpetual Protocol’s revenues are entirely dependent on trading volume, which means a decrease in trading and DeFi activity would lead to a decline in them.3. Centralized Governance and Token SupplyAs we know, a substantial portion of Perpetual Protocol’s token supply is held by the team and investors. This poses a major risk in that governance could potentially be controlled by a few entities. In addition, governance is not yet fully decentralized.4. Regulatory ConcernsAs previously mentioned, Perpetual Protocol is not available to users in the United States because of regulatory concerns. Pressure from governments have ratcheted up across all different areas and stakeholders within the industry, whether it be miners, stablecoin issuers, exchanges, or lending platforms.5. Fast Moving DeFi Derivatives LandscapeDeFi evolves at an incredible pace, and the competitive landscape is constantly shifting. Particularly with the derivatives landscape being so nascent, it’s possible a competitor or new entrant takes share in the market as quickly as Perpetual Protocol did.6. Crypto Bear MarketCrypto prices have fallen drastically over the past few months. Were the market to decline further, PERP, as a small-cap token, could see declines far greater than the market average.ConclusionNot everything is perfect with Perpetual Protocol: The project is still young, and in an unsettled sector of DeFi. Governance is still also highly centralized and the protocol has struggled with low voter turnout.That being said, Perpetual Protocol seems to be an incredibly promising project. The protocol has an innovative design, strong token economics and value accrual mechanisms, explosive growth that indicates product-market fit, dominant competitive positioning in a growing vertical, and a potentially undervalued token. Importantly, it has the numbers to back all of this up.Could PERP emerge from a potential bear market as a future DeFi blue chip?Up to you to decide.Thank you to Weiting Chen and Lucas Campbell for their help with this piece!Disclosure: The author does not hold PERP and has no affiliation to Perpetual Protocol.Action stepsResearch Perpetual Protocol Level up on more Bankless resources on perpetuals How to use perpetuals for non-speculatorsHow to make bank off the funding rateMeet the Nation: Perpetual ProtocolAMA: dYdX Founder, Antonio Juliano",https://www.bankless.com/is-perp-undervalued,2021-07-22T00:00:00.000Z,"https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/image/fetch/w_1200,h_600,c_limit,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https-3a-2f-2fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com-2fpublic-2fimages-2f2556aeef-76f5-4eed-a39f-8310d066db2d_1596x898.jpg",Ben Giove,Bankless,blog,,Unknown Error

People that longed CryptoPunks and ArtBlocks NFTs this weekend are longing the dominance of Ethereum as a value-settlement layer, and therefore also a cultural-transmission layer on the internet.Grabbing What’s on the TableCryptoPunks were already a pretty hot market throughout all of last week, but things turned a new corner when someone purchased a knitted-cap ape cryptopunk for 1,600 ETH ($3.7M).That someone turned out to be Gary Vee. (Remember when we had him on Bankless?)Just three hours later, someone followed up that purchased with a 2,250 ETH ($5.5M) purchase of bought a gold-chained ape.…and then after that, a twitter rumor circulated that Three Arrows Capital, led by Su Zhu and Kyle Davies, purchased 100 different CryptoPunks, and even went as far as coordinating with miners to ensure that all purchases got included in the same block.Later it would turn out that this particular purchase wasn’t 3AC, but a member of the CryptoPunk community instead, who “swept the floor” and bought all the cheap Punks they could get their hands on!But, as it turns out, Three Arrows Capital had coincidentally already been buying CryptoPunks and other ‘blue chip’ NFTs.All this was enough to send the CryptoPunk markets into a frenzy this weekend. New CryptoPunk all-time highs were set across basically all metrics: total sales, unique new buyers, average USD value, total exchange volume.“CryptoPunks” even began trending on Twitter.Business and finance, lolThe Punk frenzy has massive spillovers into other NFTs too. The floor prices (the lowest price found for an NFT of a particular set) all steeply rose from previous levels, putting a final nail in the “NFT Bear Market” meme.Why Now?So why did this happen now? What was so special about Friday and Saturday that triggered the Punk weekend mania?For the past few months, you might have heard the NFT Bear Market phrase being thrown around. That phrase was uttered largely by those who weren’t paying attention and had cast the NFT industry as a one-and-done.While many speculators got burned and left, there was a deep consolidation towards quality in the NFT world…and that ultimately resulted in a secondary market supply shortage.This weekend’s Punk mania was the result of a frenzied grab to claim the remaining supply of OG Ethereum cultural NFTs, as a bet that Ethereum is on the cusp of going full mainstream.The bankless thesis believes crypto protocols like Ethereum will become the settlement layer for the world’s value. CryptoPunks and other fundamental NFTs with deep ties to Ethereum are the earliest cultural artifacts native to this revolution and therefore are inextricably linked to the protocol itself.As Ethereum rises to global recognition, so do the NFTs on it that represent a core part of Ethereum itself.While the crypto-revolution is a revolution in money and finance, it will manifest instead as a revolution in art and culture. I believe enough people are tuned into that reality, either consciously or subconsciously, and felt major FOMO about owning a piece of the OG NFT project, as Ethereum slowly rises to dominate the global conversation around money and assets.At least, I can only speak from experience, because I caught the FOMO bug myself, and finally decided to pull the trigger on Punk #1118:My mom doesn’t understand why I bought a CryptoPunk with real money…this post is for you mom 💀NFT projects driving Gas prices upLast week, several new NFT projects spiked gas prices to well above 1,000 gwei.Mila Kunis’ Stoner Cats NFTs sold out within 35 minutes, triggering some not-so-nostalgic memories of 2017 ICOs, and also spiked gas prices to 1,500.Just a few hours after the Stoner Cats all got sold, gas prices were back to over 1,000 gwei for the Vogu Collection NFT sale event, and a few recent ArtBlocks released have pushed gas prices back above 100 gwei levels as well.It’s now obvious that NFTs have been hot all along, and the market has just realized that the NFT Bear Market meme was just a meme all along.On top of all this…it’s EIP 1559 week!All of this NFT craziness is ahead of EIP 1559, which goes live THIS THURSDAY 🔥Moving forward, all the NFT speculation and minting going on Ethereum will start burning ETH, and this last week showed that NFT demand was sufficient in-of-itself to produce meaningful block space demand for Ethereum.But NFTs are just one of the many things that are alive and well in the Ethereum ecosystem.Join our three EIP 1559 Livestreams this week! 🔥

The regulation story is still playing out, but it’s important to note that you do not see the regulatory headwinds reflected in the price of ETH.When the U.S. infrastructure bill came out on the 30th, ETH price went from $2,383 to $2,465.

The SEC can't stop crypto.,,"DDOSing the Regulators The strategy for getting through this phase of hostile crypto-regulation is simple. Don’t stop. Instead, speed up. It’s easy to say this from the armchairs of a writer at a media studio, and not a DeFi-team who’s trying to not go to jail, so I apologize for that. But when I look at the industry, I view it from a macro-level view. The builders who are frustrated by the SEC aren’t going to stop building, they’re just going to build differently or in different jurisdictions. And now, we have more builders than we’ve ever had. Not only that, but crypto has more sub-sectors than it’s ever had before, which means more surface area for more builders. As I said in last week’s opening note, a linear increase of builders creates an exponentially increasing rate of progress. While individual teams and orgs need to proceed with caution with regards to regulators, when you zoom out and look at the holistic body of crypto, we are simply brute-forcing the industry into success by integrating ourselves with the legacy world. If you’ve gotten scared about the SEC, the treasury, or whatever regulatory body, remember that crypto has already won the war. It won in 2009 when the first Bitcoin block was mined. It won again in 2015 when the first Ethereum block was mined. And it’s been winning every single new block that’s appended to the ledger. These systems are designed to win. The regulators are going up against a system that is optimized to beat them. Who do you think is going to capitulate to the other?

Let’s keep them waiting. Let’s keep building. - David Actions Execute any good market opportunities you saw Become a premium subscriber and get a free t-shirt RSVP to BanklessDAO’s Season 2 launch event with Bankless HQ","Dear Bankless Nation,Two completely different themes have dominated crypto in the recent news cycles.The regulators are here, and they’re not playing nicelyThe pace of innovation is rapidly acceleratingAt first glance, these things seem completely unrelated, but as regulators come to implement their controls, the rapidly accelerating pace of innovation will incentivize regulators to take an even heavier-handed approach.Nerf the SECIt’s clear that Gary Gensler and the SEC are going to take a hardline approach to this industry. If you missed the Friday Weekly Rollup, we discussed this topic at length (here, if you missed it).Raoul Pal summarized it well in this tweet thread:TL;DR: It seems like the SEC wants everything to be a security. If they get their way, the definition of a security will be watered down, rather than impost meaningful reporting requirements on token issuers.So far, the SEC has signaled an expansion of their jurisdiction to envelop all of crypto, without illustrating that they understand the implications of doing so. (Which is only natural for any governmental organization — justify your existence or get your funding pulled.)Sure, you can appoint yourself as the regulatory agency that’s responsible for “regulating” crypto.But be careful what you wish for Mr. Gensler.What’s the more likely outcome? That you regulate crypto, or that crypto regulates you?By its very design, crypto has won a thumb war with Nation-States. You can build Nation-States using crypto, but you can’t build crypto using Nation-States.When a Nation-State attempts to regulate something that is bigger than itself, in order for it to be “successful”, it needs to redefine what it means to regulate something. What Raoul Pal is saying in his above thread is that if the SEC does indeed want to tick the box of “regulate crypto”, it’s going to need to seriously reduce the definition of what it means “to regulate”.Remember, this industry is designed to be regulation-resistant. That’s what censorship resistance means.Crypto is about to nerf the SEC.Okay, SEC, so everything is security now… all the DeFi tokens, all the social tokens, all the gaming assets, all the JPEGs.Whatcha gonna do about it?In the time you’ve read this article, there have been 100 new tokens minted. Please, go ahead and spend 1,000 man-hours and $10M doing due diligence on these next 100 tokens you’re convinced are securities. Meanwhile, crypto just made 100 more.Permissionless.In our Crypto Renaissance podcast (a Bankless Nation favorite), guest Josh Rosenthal illustrated how the Renaissance was fueled by the printing press. The printing press reduced the cost of spreading ideas down to near-zero, and these revolutionary ideas were able to break free from the top-down control of oppressive organized religion.They were about to print ideas faster than religion was able to capture and control them. The printing press DDOS’d the Catholic Church, and it created one of the greatest wealth and cultural creation events in human history.If the SEC wants to regulate crypto, its actions so far haven’t accounted for how we have a ‘security’-printing press in the form of ERC20 tokens. If the SEC wants to regulate crypto, it’s going to have to severely diminish what it means to ‘be regulated’, or else it won’t ‘be regulated’ at all.Crypto-Gaming: Adding a Motor to the Printing PressWe just recorded an amazing podcast with A16z’s Arianna Simpson on the coming revolution to the gaming industry. It’s an episode you don’t want to miss, especially when so many of us in crypto have fond nostalgic memories of games like Diablo II or World of Warcraft, where playing the gaming and finding loot had meaningful in-game consequences.Now with the integration of crypto assets into the same gaming environments we already know, “meaningful consequences” can migrate out of the game and into the real world.Crypto gaming is going to take us from ~1,000 DeFi tokens and 100,000+ NFTs, to millions and millions of in-game tokens, both of the ERC20 and ERC721 categories.Imagine this: You’re playing your favorite MMORPG. After you kill that really hard boss, he drops a Legendary Longsword of Flame. That item will have an issuer, its value will be based on the common enterprise of the team behind the game, and you may even expect it to go up in value. So it’s a security?That MMORPG that you love?It’s a security-token printing press.Can’t wait to hear how my new sword fits under SEC regulatory guidance.Axie’s are the foundation for the Axie Infinity universe. They’re also capital assets (like the ones found on the NYSE!) because you can breed to Axie’s together in order to make a third, which also has a market value.Does the SEC really want us to let them know every time an Axie mates?DDOSing the RegulatorsThe strategy for getting through this phase of hostile crypto-regulation is simple.Don’t stop. Instead, speed up.It’s easy to say this from the armchairs of a writer at a media studio, and not a DeFi-team who’s trying to not go to jail, so I apologize for that.

The system aggregates users’ deposits into Aave, Compound, and C.R.E.A.M. Finance and tranches the ensuing yields into senior and junior risk profiles.Senior SMART Yield bonds are represented by ERC-721 NFTs that are known as sBonds. This is similar to how Uniswap V3 liquidity provider positions are expressed as NFTs. Conversely, junior bonds are known as jBonds and are represented by fungible ERC-20 tokens.Ideally, both sBond and jBond holders earn yields. However, if the APY provided by the underlying lending market dips below the yield guaranteed to senior bonds, then junior bondholders cover the shortfall.That said, let’s look at two simplified scenarios from the BarnBridge whitepaper to illustrate how this looks in action. In Scenario 1 both types of bonds are in the green, while in Scenario 2 only the sBonds are netting a positive ROI.Scenario 1 📈Scenario 2 📉👩‍🏫️ Bankless BarnBridge tip:BarnBridge offers a third decentralized product, known as SMART Exposure. It can help investors “passively rebalance between any two assets via tokenized strategies.” Keep it on your radar accordingly! 📡How to earn fixed yield via SMART YieldSince SMART Yield offers senior bondholders a fixed yield, we now specifically turn our attention to sBonds. If you’re interested in acquiring sBonds, you can follow these steps:Navigate to BarnBridge’s SMART Yield dashboard.Pick a stablecoin pool from one of the three integrated lending markets. Note: the highest guaranteed APY right now is the 5.72% rate offered by the C.R.E.A.M. Finance USDT pool.Click on the “Details” button for your pool of choice, at which point you’ll be taken to the pool’s main Deposit interface. After reviewing the market info, including the Average senior maturity metric, connect your wallet and press “Deposit.”You’ll now be asked to pick your preferred tranche. Select the Senior tranche Fixed APY option. Before proceeding, keep in mind that “your deposits will be locked in the bond until [its] maturity date is reached.”You’ll be taken to a Senior deposit interface. Go down to the bottom of the UI and click the “Enable” button. Complete the ensuing transaction through your wallet to allow BarnBridge to spend your funds.Now it’s time to set up your bond’s terms. Input your desired deposit amount, e.g. 500 USDC, and your desired maturity date. BarnBridge offers preset options for 1-month, 3-month, 6-month, and 1-year terms.After you have everything set up how you want, review the Transaction summary section at bottom of the UI. If everything looks good, press “Deposit” and complete the ensuing deposit transaction through your wallet.Once your deposit confirms, you’ll receive an sBond in the form of an ERC-721 NFT. Use this NFT to redeem your principal + interest through SMART Yield at your sBond’s maturity date.You can now track the performance of your bonds as you please via BarnBridge’s Portfolio page!Zooming outThe SMART Yield system facilitates compelling fixed-rate yield opportunities for DeFi investors.Notably, BarnBridge’s rollout of its SMART Yield and SMART Alpha systems this year marks the completion of the vision the project laid out in its initial whitepaper. Now the name of the game is expanding the utility of sBonds and jBonds and making it easier to use them.To that end, BarnBridge is collaborating with other DeFi protocols on using SMART Bonds as collateral and exploring further deployments on L2 scaling solutions like Optimism, Arbitrum, and beyond.Lastly, keep your eyes peeled on DeFi’s first tokenized risk protocol because the team is currently building out SMART Leverage, a lending market, and SMART Fiat, a “fixed income asset token” that can foster a native capital market for BarnBridge.Action steps📖 Read “Whitepaper complete: where do we go from here?” by BarnBridge👨‍🌾️ Head to the BarnBridge dashboard and lock in your fixed yield👀 Give SMART Alpha a look",https://www.bankless.com/how-to-earn-fixed-yield-on-barnbridge,2021-09-28T00:00:00.000Z,"https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/image/fetch/w_1200,h_600,c_limit,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https-3a-2f-2fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com-2fpublic-2fimages-2fe83ae13d-6b48-4139-bcf1-7262f12cf74e_1380x776.jpg",William M.

b823e98a5bd64a273d30fdc5954ab3baded3912b02264412f7750a50f4d4a011,Play to Earn is the Future of Gaming,Attract and reward. That's the crypto business model.,,"What the future of crypto gaming looks like A question that I've been asked several times, and one that I've asked myself on countless occasions is: What will play to earn gaming look like in the next year? As with anything crypto-related, the possibilities are endless but here are my two cents: From the existing play to earn games, we’re going to see even higher quality gaming experiences. As we know, humans are always looking for the next engaging, more exciting thing. Companies are going to have to up the ante to truly compete with AAA gaming experiences so that users don’t have to choose between game quality vs value able to be extracted. If this comes to pass, the L2 solutions these games are integrated with are going to be crucial to their next leg of success. The more accessible these solutions become, the more wallets, tokens, games they support, the more ingrained the experience will become. I envisage a future where gamers don’t even realize that they’re hooked up to an L2 solution within their favourite game and that it all happens at face value, making the interactions frictionless, and mass adoption much easier. So what’s next in my opinion? I believe that over the next twelve months giant gaming companies are going to stick their foot in the play to earn door . I’m no prophet, but I don’t think they’ll waste any time getting into the market. With the already established play to earn games in the space, we’ve got a head start. What Gods Unchained ( for example ) has, is readily built game economics that caters to the crypto industry as well as traditional gamers. Alongside that, we’ve already formed a deep integration with a scaling solution to ensure we don’t run into any issues from this perspective moving forward. I do think these bigger corporations are going to need to upskill their staff ridiculously fast in order to reach the same industry knowledge and understanding that those already in it have. Once they do, I believe it will result in that mass adoption I touched on earlier, and a flood of new play to earn users into both games of their offerings, and already existing play to earn offerings. One door that I don’t think has been fully opened by play to earn gaming yet is the DeFi potential of the space. For the more crypto-savvy in the ecosystem, this will increase their earning potential and therefore result in more interaction and liquidity. To be able to take a gaming token earned in-game, just through time spent, and put it into a liquidity pool for passive earnings is something that I think will bolster the ecosystem even more ( the SLP-ETH Uniswap V3 pool is a great example) . Rightfully so, DeFi applications have been compared to financial games. Although the space rapidly evolves the core principle is parallel to play to earn where the user performs some sort of work or takes on a variable risk and can then be rewarded for it. Combining the multisensory nature of gaming with these economic games is going to be a major catalyst for the next wave of adoption. As well as a shift in the traditional balance between gamers and game creators. In this new world, everyone can benefit from the game’s success, and that simply isn’t true today. Play to earn gaming is here, and it’s here to stay. I’m proud to be a part of this space, and I can’t wait to see what’s to come.","Dear Bankless Nation,Have you noticed? The shift from attract and extract to attract and reward?Centralized institutions create lucrative incentives for people to use their products—great UX, sign-up bonuses, better technology.But once our guards are down the profit-seeking cranks up. They create barriers to exit and entrap users in a walled garden. Then they extract maximal value from our coffers.The gaming industry congregated around the same model, which means it’s just another industry that crypto can disrupt.Crypto doesn’t do well with closed platforms. Composability and permissionless execution are fundamental values that we expect to see from the protocols we use.In order to retain users, protocols cannot close their borders and force us to play ball. Instead, they must find proactive ways to keep users happy.Chris Clay tells us how the crypto gaming industry will do it.- RSAP.S. Catch our recent episode where talk Play to Earn with Arianna Simpson.Guest Writer: Chris Clay, Game Director of Gods Unchained: The former Game Director of Magic: The Gathering Arena, Chris Clay led MTGA from its troubled first playable release to a genre favorite that generated over $120M in revenue in its first year. He has spent his career pushing the boundaries of technology, from early pioneering in 3D character setup and design to laying the groundwork for massive multiplayer games at Turbine. He moved across the globe to join Immutable to continue to break new ground by building game economies that benefit both game creators and game communities alike in the NFT space.Play to earn, play and earn, blockchain gaming. The names might change slightly depending on who you talk to, but the integral concept is the same. Gaming’s status quo is shifting, and the incoming paradigm is one that rewards players for spending time engaging with a game and its platform.Moreover, the birth of L2 solutions is no longer just hopium for the masses. Yes, it’s provided a scalable way to interact with the Ethereum ecosystem, but more importantly for this particular write-up, it’s empowered play to earn gaming to become a reality.Take an important pillar of traditional gaming enterprises: microtransactions. Microtransactions on mainnet are a painful experience; a typical $4.99 microtransaction quickly becomes a $34.99 transaction when gas fees are considered.It simply doesn’t make sense to transact. Traditional gaming models just don’t work in this environment.But that’s starting to change.Enter Layer 2Whether it’s Immutable X, Polygon, Optimism—whatever your flavor—each offers a solution to the exorbitant gas fees that plague Ethereum. Better yet, the implementation of these solutions finally allows for transactions of all value (from little to large) to be possible. Play to earn games can finally thrive.But you may ask, what do microtransactions have to do with play to earn games? I’ll get into that, but first, we have to understand how the world of traditional gaming works.What’s wrong with traditional gamingPay to win or freemium. These are both phrases you’ve likely heard if you’ve ever spent time gaming. In 2020, over $54 billion was spent on in-game assets. That’s a lot of money for people to put into cosmetics, accessories, or other assets that the users themselves do not own.If you read the minuscule print in the massive terms and conditions of any large gaming corporation, you’ll spot lines that explain that the assets are only being licensed to the consumer. The company can take anything you purchased or acquired through play at its whim.This is where the combination of crypto and gaming comes in to save the day.Building on Ethereum gives real ownership to its users. If you purchase an NFT, it is truly yours to do as you please. Non-custodial asset ownership is a mind-blowingly recent concept that’s genuinely making the masses question the hows and whys of the status quo. Play to earn gaming combines the entertainment value of traditional gaming with the ownership and freedom that blockchains unlock.When you put these two things together, you have a powerhouse that is primed to introduce the unlimited potential of decentralized applications to the world.The Catalysts for Gaming 3.0: Play to EarnPlay to earn gaming is not dissimilar to proof of work. The ‘work’ in this instance comes from engaging with the game and its ecosystems, an action that creates value for both the product and its users. Put simply, do some ‘work’ (engage with the game), and you get rewarded for it.Crypto assets are composable, meaning that the value earned as a reward can be kept inside the game’s ecosystem or extracted out of it as well. As an example, you can have a badass Gods Unchained card that wreaks havoc in the meta and brings you all the glory, thereby earning you more rewards, or you can take that card and go sell it on a third-party marketplace for other assets like ETH!So, why has play to earn suddenly picked up steam? There are a few compounding factors. First, the increasing mainstream awareness of crypto has meant that more people are willing to dip their toes into the space. We saw this with DeFi summer 2020 and the NFT boom.The second, the relentless menace that is COVID. On a not-seen-in-our-lifetime scale, there was a worldwide loss in employment and stability.  People lost their jobs. They were looking for new ways to earn money. The possibility that they could earn money from playing a game was unfathomable, and as the concept began to gain speed, and now we’re seeing more and more adoption in the space.The third (as I mentioned above) comes from the constraints of L1 having strangled play to earn gaming for a while now. Only very recently did scalable L2 solutions become provably functional, allowing people to truly experience what it’s like to extract value from a game. (A bit of shameless boasting here: but I’m pretty thrilled that Immutable X was able to lead the charge here, being the first of these to launch secured by Ethereum L1.)How You Earn From Crypto GamingWith all these wheels in motion, crypto gaming is kicking into gear—full steam ahead. But how and where can you play games and earn value? This answer is of course reliant on the particular game in question, but there are some common denominators across the board.1. In-game assetsTraditional games give players the ability to earn or purchase in-game items, but these are almost always trapped in the user’s account. The difference with play to earn games is that players can trade, sell, and use these items in a noncustodial way. Let’s say you breed a ridiculously rare Axie, or pull a super-rare Gods Unchained card – a play to earn user has the non-custodial asset ownership which empowers them to say, “Hey, I’m going to sell this on a marketplace and put the earnings into my wallet of choice.” Boom. You just made money from gaming.2. Game related tokensWe’re also seeing a rise in gaming tokens—GODS, AXS, GHST, MANA, ILV, etc. These tokens are all designed to bolster their game’s economy and simultaneously reward their users for their engagement. For the most part, you can earn these tokens in-game.Then whether it’s an in-game utility that empowers users to create higher-value assets, staking rewards, or external composability, these tokens are yet another way players can extract value from their time spent playing the game.Look at the forge in Gods Unchained for example: not only does the GODS token have external composability, but it will also be used in-game, in tandem with the flux currency to fuse non-NFT assets into NFTs. These assets can then be taken to be sold, traded, and bought between users.3. Content Creation & EducationThis one is not directly from the game, but it’s an incredibly valuable piece of the gaming economy. People need to understand how to use these games. Whether it’s educating people on how to create wallets, what signing transactions actually means, or figuring out the best way to explain decentralized wallet ownership to people who’ve never dabbled in the space before, there are common obstacles.For an average gamer with no experience in crypto, the whole thing might come across as downright terrifying. Everyone in the space needs to continue to work to remove these roadblocks to adoption so that everyone can experience the benefits crypto games have to offer. There’s a massive opportunity to help the next wave of users onboard into this emerging economy. Who knows...you could be the next PewDiePie.The Start of Something BigWith all of this excitement above, I do want to touch on one point: I truly believe that we’re only brushing the surface of the potential of play to earn gaming.It’s so early in its implementation, and I believe that the success we’re seeing across the industry now is only a tiny slice of what’s to come. I’ll bring up the NFT boom example again: we saw people scoffing at the idea of digital art, music, assets, but just as the laughing began, interest started to skyrocket.As people came to understand the inherent worth in NFTs and true asset ownership, there was not only crypto-industry interest, but it broke into the mainstream world.The day I saw Beeple NFT news on CNN was the day I knew that the world as we know it is changing and that it’s up only from here. I truly believe that the same thing is relevant with crypto gaming: L2s have just started functioning, so we’re at the beginning of what’s going to be a complete gamechanger to the gaming industry. Like all new technology, there will be initial waves of resistance, but once the mainstream public is aware of the scalable offerings, through news or marketing or just a really fun game, I believe the narrative will change and mass adoption will begin.A huge reason I left the traditional gaming industry behind to pursue a career in play to earn gaming was that I truly believe in the importance of bringing the accessible earning potential of crypto to millions, in a familiar, entertaining format. With my gaming industry experience, I genuinely can’t wait to be able to reverse the current status quo and watch gamers have that penny-dropping moment of “I can actually own my assets, I can buy/sell/trade without the overlords of the corporations watching my every move, and I can earn real-world value just by playing a game – something that I was going to be doing anyway?!”Seeing that moment of realization in even a small proportion of the population that we have now has hardened my resolve. I want to make sure that this concept goes worldwide.What the future of crypto gaming looks likeA question that I've been asked several times, and one that I've asked myself on countless occasions is: What will play to earn gaming look like in the next year?As with anything crypto-related, the possibilities are endless but here are my two cents: From the existing play to earn games, we’re going to see even higher quality gaming experiences.

We’re the Web3 barbarians, the metaversal barbarians, or call it whatever you’d like. I’ve admittedly been thinking about it lately after restarting legendary strategy game franchise Sid Meier’s Civilization . I was reviewing the Civilopedia wiki and found a … surprisingly authoritative and fair definition of barbarians. Here, some key conclusions to note: The etymology of “barbarian” comes from ancient state insiders literally not understanding what their nomadic outsiders were saying/speaking. The outsiders weren’t dumb, they simply spoke a differerent language and lived per a drastically different (and freer) culture. Accordingly, barbarians weren’t backwards or uncontacted but instead were non-state peoples “that existed in tandem with nations.” Resisting clean rule, barbarians were sometimes pirates and at other times key extenders of diplomatic networks and trade networks. So there was back and forth, and nations tried to “control and appropriate” the barbarians’ surplus productions. Yet ultimately the two sides were interdependent and did live in tandem. Of course, to compare the barbarians of yore with us metaversal, crypto-savvy adventurers today is a bit like comparing apples and oranges, but there are some compelling similarities here. Indeed, we today may be mavericks on the frontier, so to speak, but our relationships with the “insiders” is one of interdependence. Us “outsiders” may speak of things like Web3 and NFTs that they don’t understand yet, but we can extend their cultural and trade networks. It’s just a fact. Our systems may be different, but they aren’t backwards. And we may have already had our share of inner-outer disputes, but together states and us modern barbarians can make things better for everyone. So it was in the past, so it is now. Going mainstream “Because night has fallen and the barbarians haven't come. And some of our men just in from the border say there are no barbarians any longer.","Dear Bankless Nation,We are the metaversal barbarians at the gate.No, we’re not savages. We’re outsiders, so we have a different language and different systems than many in the mainstream.Yet our minor language is in the process of producing a major literature. And some people in the old world are hailing us as dangerous invaders accordingly!As such, here’s my call for us “barbarians” to stick together ...-WMPWhat are we waiting for?“What are we waiting for, assembled in the forum?The barbarians are due here today.”
So starts the first lines of one of my all-time favorite pieces, “Waiting for the Barbarians,” a 1904 poem by Greek poet Constantine P. Cavafy.I reckon it would resonate with many in our “rebels with a cause” ecosystem. Why? As writer Lidija Haas noted in The New Republic last year, one powerful message from the poem is as follows:“The so-called barbarians stand in for that other, lesser person—coded as foreign, threatening, criminal—who can be used to scare the populace and justify any authoritarian measures. This person doesn’t exist but needs to be invented.”Think about how Ethereum, DeFi, NFTs, etc. have increasingly started facing painfully uninformed, and at times flat-out unfair, regulatory heat. Or how some normies have been blanket accusing anything related to NFTs as thoroughly-scammy, rotten-to-the-core cons.Sure, there are plenty of criticisms we could field and debate, and many Web3ers and NFTers are happy to do so. But whether the naysayers realize it or even care, there is an anti-liberty undercurrent to their most venomous invectives, and it’s starting to feel like us crypto nomads are the barbarians in this equation, right. We’re due now, our cue is now.Look, there are plenty of reasons to take the high road, to engage in good faith with these difficulties, to keep explaining the things that others don’t know! On and on and on!Yet to be holistic we have to be realistic. We’re increasingly being cast as modern barbarians. And there are interesting subtleties to what I’m getting at here, so I’ll explain further in the next section. But what are we to do in response?I say first we should recognize the position we’re in. Then act accordingly.Why we’re the barbariansFrom the “Barbarian Clans” definition on Civilopedia.We’re the Web3 barbarians, the metaversal barbarians, or call it whatever you’d like. I’ve admittedly been thinking about it lately after restarting legendary strategy game franchise Sid Meier’s Civilization. I was reviewing the Civilopedia wiki and found a … surprisingly authoritative and fair definition of barbarians.Here, some key conclusions to note:The etymology of “barbarian” comes from ancient state insiders literally not understanding what their nomadic outsiders were saying/speaking.

So it was in the past, so it is now.Going mainstream“Because night has fallen and the barbarians haven't come.And some of our men just in from the border say there are no barbarians any longer.Now what’s going to happen to us without barbarians?Those people were a kind of solution.”
These are the final lines of Cavafy’s “Waiting for the Barbarians.” They describe how the menacing barbarians that everyone had previously feared never actually existed at all. Instead, the savages were more fable than reality.To that point, that’s how I’m reading much of the mainstream accusations and critiques against Ethereum and NFTs lately. Some insiders are drumming up us outsiders as monsters that we’re not. And as we “monsters” continue to not arrive at the gate because we were already inside the city walls the whole time, more and more folks are going to realize that the metaversal barbarians never existed at all.So circling back, we’ve recognized our position but what do we do now?The stakes are high, because if we make many missteps then crypto and NFTs may simply give way to central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and Fortnite + Facebook’s closed metaverse over time. That’s not the future that any of us here believe in; it’s not what we became Bankless for and “barbarians” for in the first place.So here’s what I say we do: we go high where they go low. We educate where they misinform. We build where they wither. We evade where they go all-out. We become diplomats where they engage. And if we keep doing these things, then there’s a decent chance we change the course of human history for the better of all.They can see us as barbarians, and fight us like we’re savages. But we’re really just rebels with a powerful cause. And that cause is the liberty that calls out in every human heart. Freedom of association, freedom of commerce, freedom to dream new ways. To us wild folk, that makes all the difference in the world.Action steps🌺 Read “Rhizomatic NFTs” by Metaversal🌌 Read “Connecting Metagalaxies with Ethereum” by Metaversal",https://www.bankless.com/metaversal-barbarians-at-the-gate,2021-10-07T00:00:00.000Z,"https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/image/fetch/w_1200,h_600,c_limit,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https-3a-2f-2fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com-2fpublic-2fimages-2fe065515e-d6a5-48a8-92e0-3aada5e38bb6_1280x931.jpg",William M.

These ideas revolve around providing a ‘public goods’ style grant that will provide funds to people who want to move from a traditional job into full time DAO work ... 50% of all secondary sales revenue will be allocated to the DAOpunks public treasury to continue funding these initiatives.”Theme to watch: DAOs increasingly turning to NFTs to further their goals, foster culture, and improve self-sufficiency.2) Supdrive 🕹️Described as an “Art Blocks for games,” Supdrive is an on-chain fantasy console for minting games as unique NFTs. The project is steered by dom, a Nouns co-Founder and the creator of Loot and Blitmaps. Supdrive currently doesn’t have a set launch date, but the original target was October 2021 so it seems plausible we could see it hit mainnet by year’s end.Key resources: Twitter | DiscordWhat they’re saying:“These games all run on the Supdrive Virtual Firmware, a toolkit that allows games to be written in concise instructions that are gas friendly and ideal for on-chain storage. Although every game will be released in fixed edition sizes, every edition is unique — every version of the game will be different, whether it's color palettes, difficulty, special abilities, or more.”Theme to watch: Innovators like dom and company continuing to push the boundaries of NFT gaming.3) Nouns Party 🎉The Noun project is an NFT avatar experiment that has attracted tremendous interest in recent weeks. So much interest, in fact, that most of the earliest Nouns have been selling at auction for +100 ETH each. As such, the co-owners of Noun #13 joined forces to create Nouns Party, a dapp that creates a rolling fund for groups of strangers to bid on Nouns together. If the “party” wins an auction, the Noun in question gets fractionalized for bidders via Fractional.Key resources: WebsiteWhat they’re saying:“Nouns are an experimental attempt to improve the formation of on-chain avatar communities. Nouns Party is an extension of the core ideas powering nouns, but with the community in mind. Now, with Nouns Narty, anyone can contribute to a collective vault so that the community can win nouns together.”Theme to watch: Group bidding on highly-sought NFTs becoming increasingly common.4) Doodle Labs 🖍️Doodle Labs is an NFT minting platform directly powered by Art Blocks technology. The upstart project focuses on facilitating limited-edition, generative NFT drops by mainstream artists and brands.Key resources: Website | Twitter | DiscordWhat they’re saying:“Doodle Labs is dedicated to bringing established IRL artists and brands to the blockchain. Our platform is powered by Art Blocks’ generative minting technology, bringing you high quality collectible NFTs written on-chain.”Theme to watch: New projects experimenting with the Art Blocks minting model toward new ends.5) Cool Cat Creatures 😸As Meebits are to CryptoPunks and Mutant Apes are to Bored Apes, Creatures are an upcoming companion release for Cool Cat holders. The Cool Cats team is planning to release Creatures along with an associated egg and item system in Q4 2021.Key resources: Twitter | DiscordWhat they’re saying:“Similar to Cool Cats, these Creatures are made up of a variety of components including a range of faces, bodies, arms, tails, and colors … Use items to interact with your Creature and grow them from egg to final form.”Theme to watch: Top NFT projects continuing to widen and bolster their ecosystems with companion drops.Action steps🎨 Read “Meet Manifold” by Metaversal🐮 Read “Multi-year NFT bull run?” by Metaversal",https://www.bankless.com/5-nft-projects-to-watch-q4-2021,2021-10-28T00:00:00.000Z,"https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/video/upload/e_loop,vs_40/bdcxyaiu7tsvmgg2pafp.gif",William M.

Perhaps you listened to our episode with Zeus of Olympus DAO or Scoopy Truples from Alchemix or Jai from Rari. Or maybe you saw BanklessDAO propose a new index with a number of DeFi 2.0 protocols. Is DeFi 2.0 a thing? I think there’s enough going on here to warrant a label yes. One trend in DeFi 2.0 is the way DeFi 2.0 puts yield-generating assets to work.

While Compound lets users lend and borrow against staples like ETH and WBTC, Abracadabra does the same, but for yield-generating assets like those locked in Yearn vaults or staked Sushi. Why does Abracadabra bring utility to yield-generating assets when Compound cannot? Because Yearn and Sushi did not exist when Compound was launched. What we’re seeing here is the continual evolution of DeFi building new primitives on top of existing primitives. We’re unlocking new branches in a tech tree.

This tactic will show you how to use Abracadabra to borrow and farm with MIM!Goal: Learn how to borrow and use MIMSkill: IntermediateEffort: 1 hour of researchROI: The possibility of higher yields with leverageAn introduction to Abracadabra.money“Currently, a lot of assets, such as yVaults have locked in capital, capital that you own, but can’t use. Abracadabra is here to give you an opportunity to use it.” — Abracadabra.moneyAbracadabra is a decentralized bank of sorts, like Maker.Yet Abracadabra is deployed on a handful of chains and accepts interest-bearing tokens for collateral, whereas Maker is still devising its multi-chain strategy and has focused on non-yielding assets like ETH, WBTC, and so forth.Remember: the idea with interest-bearing tokens is that they steadily grow in value over time as your underlying position (which yield-bearing tokens represent) continues to be productively used in DeFi.As such, Abracadabra unlocks further utility for yield-bearing tokens because the protocol makes it easy to use them for leveraged yield farming.For example, let’s say you deposit wrapped ETH into Yearn’s WETH Vault and receive yield-bearing yvWETH tokens to represent your position. You deposit your yvWETH into Abracadabra, borrow MIM, trade the MIM for WETH, and then repeat from the beginning. Boom, that’s leveraged yield farming.Abracadabra under the hoodAbracadabra.money is based on the same code underpinning Sushi’s Kashi lending platform.Accordingly, Abracadabra is fundamentally a borrowing and lending platform that relies on isolated lending markets. While a project like Aave shares risk collectively across its markets, Abracadabra is able to isolate risk to individual token pairs.This isolated lending model is key, as it allows Abracadabra to support more exotic tokens like yield-bearing tokens and at a more rapid pace than what traditional lending protocols can offer.Lastly, it’s worth noting that Abracadabra users face liquidation risks, but the potential upside is that their interest-bearing tokens will grow in value and thus lessen the risk of liquidation over time.Why Abracadabra mattersAbracadabra.money launched this summer, and since then the project’s experienced a rapid influx of users and capital.Indeed, over its 5 current chain deployments (Ethereum, Arbitrum, Avalanche, BSC, and Fantom) and in as many months, Abracadabra has achieved a +$4B TVL, making it one of the biggest and fastest growth stories in DeFi this year.This surge has also placed the upstart protocol firmly in the position of being Maker’s biggest DeFi competition yet.How to borrow MIMThe borrowing process is generally the same across all of Abracadabra’s chain deployments. For the sake of simplicity, below we’ll focus on Ethereum and Sushi’s yield-bearing xSUSHI staking token.Step one is to make sure you have your collateral prepped. For xSUSHI, you could stake SUSHI on Sushi or simply purchase some on a decentralized exchange.Then visit the Abracadabra.money Borrow dashboard; connect your wallet and make sure you’re connected to the network you want, in my case Ethereum. Then click on your market of choice.Now input how much collateral you want to supply and select your desired liquidation price. These factors help you customize your position’s risk profile. 
At this point and going forward, pay close attention to your:Max collateral ratio - The maximum amount of debt a user can borrow   Borrow fee - The one-off fee added to your debt when you borrow MIM Interest - Annualized percent that your debt will increase each year Liquidation fee - Paid to liquidators upon position liquidations)If everything looks good, use your wallet to complete the deposit transaction. Once that confirms, you’ll receive your selected amount of MIM! Now you can use MIM as you would any stablecoin!You can manage your open position through the same dashboard that you made your deposit through. Here you’ll be able to do things like add more collateral, borrow more MIM, repay your loan, and so forth. You can also use your Mana Bar to track your risk of liquidation at any given time.How to use Abracadabra for leveraged yield farmingYou can manually do leveraged yield farming via Abracadabra, but there’s no need for going through that process if you don’t want to. That’s because Abracadabra lets you leverage a position through a single multi-part transaction.Before proceeding, just keep in mind that with leverage comes heightened liquidation risks. “Different from what happens in unleveraged positions, if the leveraged position gets liquidated, users will not have any assets in their possession,” the project’s doc explains.All that said, be cautious and deposit responsibly if you do decide to try.To open up a leveraged position on Abracadabra, head to the Borrow dashboard and select your market of choice.Then in the deposit interface, click the “Change Leverage” button.Pick the number of leverage loops you desire and your swap tolerance. You’ll receive a series of position projections based on your inputs.Next, first-time users will have to go through a few approval transactions and then a final deposit transaction. Once that’s done, Abracadabra will have automatically leveraged your position for you!You can manage your position and de-leverage it through the same interface. For a comprehensive overview of the deleveraging process, check out Abracadabra’s docs.💫 Other Abracadabra resources 💫SPELL/sSPELL: Abracadabra.money’s governance/staking tokenAbracadabra Bridge: A token bridge to help people access the project’s multi-chain deployments.MIM3POOL: A Curve pool for MIM, DAI, USDC, and USDT swaps.Staking dashboard: For staking SPELL in order to earn a cut of the protocol’s earnings via sSPELL (similar to how xSUSHI works)Farms: Abracadabra’s incentivized liquidity pools.The big pictureWith Abracadabra.money, you can earn yields on your crypto and borrow against it at the same time. This opens up powerful new possibilities for DeFi users who want to live off their yields and minimize their tax liabilities.Zooming out, Abracadabra’s rate of growth has been incredible this year, and its multi-chain strategy has the project well-positioned to keep gaining ground in rapid fashion. Keep this one on your radar… or rather, in your spellbooks.Action steps🧙 Have some interest-bearing tokens sitting around?

Well, that’s a hard pill to swallow for those of us who know better. In today’s post, I do some parrying and critiquing of these critics. I don’t have all the answers or all the insights, but ultimately I hope to further the conversation on how and why much of our work in the cryptoeconomy is important and should be defended. So, how about a little defending then? -WMP Let’s get right into it. Some mainstream critics argue that the Ethereum and NFT ecosystems are a giant hyper-capitalist bubble that’s destroying the environment. These thrusts can be parried in various ways. First, an international community of users are collectively building Ethereum as a credibly neutral “civilizational trust layer,” or rather a “global public utility and settlement layer.” By the nature of this structuring and the arbitrary programmability of smart contracts, the economic and political possibilities available here are limited only by our imaginations. For instance, I reckon in 100 years every labor union will be a DAO. Or consider how even now you could undoubtedly code up a dapp based on the Bank of the People, an anarchist credit union devised by the “father of anarchism” Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. So to hail Ethereum and NFTs as inherently and thoroughly hyper-capitalist is to miss the forest for the trees, and a lot more. They’re DIY public goods infra, and that will mean a lot of different things to a lot of different people over time. Believe it. As for the eco-disaster line, it’s rhetorically insincere. Currently, Ethereum appears to consume less annual energy than the U.S. video game industry; also it’s estimated that soon at the base layer “Ethereum will only use the [annual energy] equivalent of between 710 and 1650 average Australians in the future.” Not bad for the 21st century’s public cultural and financial settlement layer, right? What will Visa and Mastercard’s energy numbers look like in comparison? Did you know “gm” means g’day mate? 😄 Moreover, note how the great “modular” layer-two migration has also just begun and how going forward the proliferation of these L2 scaling solutions will support millions and then billions of users in green fashion. This is the way, and it’s already happening. On utilitarian grounds, then, and considering how many people and the types of people Ethereum and NFTs have already empowered (by and large kind, proactive, and smart), I think their energy use to date is more than justified. And it’s vastly justified considering 1) how much activity Ethereum + L2s will de-physicalize or make green over time, and 2) the types of eco-friendly activities Ethereums and NFTs will increasingly facilitate coordination-wise, like green DAOs and beyond. So we can problematize and defend against the “hyper-capitalist eco-disaster” critiques easily enough, right. And I won’t even bother with the “all NFTs are scams” line, it’s utterly disingenuous. Where does that leave us? Why are people saying these things?","Dear Bankless Nation,Some in the mainstream talk about Ethereum and NFTs as if they’re monstrosities that have been loosened on the world.Well, that’s a hard pill to swallow for those of us who know better.In today’s post, I do some parrying and critiquing of these critics.

Why are people saying these things?“So it turns out the NFT hater mob isn’t gonna stop when it’s all environmentally friendly — that was just their first line of attack and they find new ones pretty quick […] it was never really about the environment.” — Jackson DameAlas, I get the sense most of these Ethereum/NFT naysayers are unwitting agents of the mainstream status quo that isn’t working. They resist what could be breaches to that status quo because of reasons of comfortability or uncomfortability, and in doing so they defend the status quo and extend it.This all sort of reminds me of John Carpenter’s 1988 film They Live, featuring Roddy Piper as “Nada” and Keith David as “Frank.”As the movie’s IMDb summary, written by Melissa Portell, notes:“Nada, a down-on-his-luck construction worker, discovers a pair of special sunglasses. Wearing them, he is able to see the world as it really is: people being bombarded by media and government with messages like ‘Stay Asleep,’ ‘No Imagination,’ ‘Submit to Authority.’ Even scarier is that he is able to see that some usually normal-looking people are in fact ugly aliens in charge of the massive campaign to keep humans subdued.”To see what I’m getting at here, you can swap out “media and government” and “aliens” for the “mainstream status quo” in general that I mentioned before.Going off that point, there’s this great scene in the movie where Nada tries to get Frank to put the glasses on to see the way things are, and they get into a fight accordingly. At first Frank can’t accept the possibility Nada could be right, but eventually he sees (Fight scene below, violence/language warning).I think those of us around Ethereum and NFTs are sort of like Nada, while many other people are like Frank right now. We’re the metaversal barbarians at the gate who’ve seen and lived beyond the city walls. They’re the city insiders who fear but actually do need the open lands beyond. Will they put on the glasses, too? Will they become nomads resisting state machines, too?“These new ways are wrong and should be avoided,” the naysayers currently say, “you should instead do things how we already do them.”In other words, you shouldn’t put on those strange glasses; you shouldn’t sell NFTs instead of shipping physical prints; you shouldn’t start a DeFi app when you can just legally start a bank; you should stay in the city walls with us like good proper citizens!Yet we here in this ecosystem and in these communities have already put on the glasses, as it were, and we look to help others do the same. The naysayers’ arguments can’t be convincing again because of this. Call us new kinds of culture angels, then, though we may still seem like crazy monsters to those who don’t know better yet. On that point, I recall an insightful quote from Antonio Gramsci:“In a time when the old is in the middle of dying and the new is not yet born, things that look like monsters may appear.”Action steps🌌 Read Ethereum is (open) metaverse infrastructure by Metaversal❌ Read Why Right-Click Savers Flunk NFTs by Metaversal",https://www.bankless.com/a-defense-of-ethereum-and-nfts,2021-11-04T00:00:00.000Z,"https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/image/fetch/w_1200,h_600,c_limit,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https-3a-2f-2fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com-2fpublic-2fimages-2f969feda8-a2f3-4024-9e75-f4641cedf54d_790x395.jpg",William M.

5fc1e06db5982aefc77fc1ff293fb0196a76dfed3e44bbf649df6b32ffd83dff,Welcome PartyBid 2.0 🎉,Bid on millions of NFTs and more with the new version of PartyBid!,,"Dear Bankless Nation, Earlier this week I wrote “How to bid on NFTs with your friends,” a Bankless tactic on how to use PartyBid. Check out the post if you haven’t yet! But if you’re still catching up, the tl;dr is that the dapp makes it easy for groups to collectively bid on choice NFTs, e.g. CryptoPunks. I return your attention to PartyBid now because today its creators, PartyDAO, just released a new optimized version of the dapp that’s going to level up group bidding for the entire NFT ecosystem. Here’s what you need to know 👇 -WMP If you’re still getting up to speed on PartyBid, note that the dapp’s initial version supported group bidding only on Foundation or Zora NFT auctions. That said, now PartyDAO is widening the playing field in a big way. That’s because the newest version of their flagship dapp supports all “Buy Now” listings on OpenSea ! Remember: OpenSea is home to millions of NFTs, so this integration considerably expands the reach of PartyBid users. Also, the “Buy Now” option opens up new sorts of collective collecting possibilities. In a press release shared with Metaversal, PartyDAO explained: “ To create a Party on an OpenSea listing, all you need to do is paste the link to that item into the regular Party creation form.

No waiting for a 24 hour auction to complete, or competing with other bidders .

But if you’re still catching up, the tl;dr is that the dapp makes it easy for groups to collectively bid on choice NFTs, e.g. CryptoPunks.I return your attention to PartyBid now because today its creators, PartyDAO, just released a new optimized version of the dapp that’s going to level up group bidding for the entire NFT ecosystem.Here’s what you need to know 👇-WMPIf you’re still getting up to speed on PartyBid, note that the dapp’s initial version supported group bidding only on Foundation or Zora NFT auctions.That said, now PartyDAO is widening the playing field in a big way. That’s because the newest version of their flagship dapp supports all “Buy Now” listings on OpenSea!Remember: OpenSea is home to millions of NFTs, so this integration considerably expands the reach of PartyBid users. Also, the “Buy Now” option opens up new sorts of collective collecting possibilities. In a press release shared with Metaversal, PartyDAO explained:“To create a Party on an OpenSea listing, all you need to do is paste the link to that item into the regular Party creation form. The Party experience is the same as usual, but with one major difference: when the Party has enough ETH, it can purchase the item instantly. No waiting for a 24 hour auction to complete, or competing with other bidders.

This new PartyBid functionality offers them the ability to party up and “raid bid” on NFTs together in curated and customizable fashion.For example, you can now create a Party that’s only open to holders of a particular ERC-20 token, and you can also specify a minimum threshold of ownership for participation. This will give DAOs and even just groups of friends the ability to set up special collecting events and beyond.🎉 Party to watch: Today the Friends With Benefits community launched a Party to buy Solvency #420. Minimum entry requirement? Holding at least 5 FWB.🎊 More PartyBid resources 🎊PartyDAO TwitterPartyDAO DiscordPartyDAO Mirror postsA new NFT social hubThe final pillar of PartyBid’s 2.0 rollout is the dapp’s madeover website.Notably, the new system now supports user profiles, trending Parties, a central activity feed, and an overhauled UI in general.These frontend advances make the project even more socially-focused than it was before. In this regard, PartyBid 2.0 is now more like an NFT social network than a mere group bidding dapp. Keep it on your radar accordingly, I say!Action steps🤝 Read “How to bid on NFTs with your friends” if you haven’t already!🤯 Watch the new Zeneca_33 | Approaching the NFT Market interview by Overpriced JPEGs!",https://www.bankless.com/welcome-partybid-20-,2021-11-18T00:00:00.000Z,"https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/image/fetch/w_1200,h_600,c_limit,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https-3a-2f-2fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com-2fpublic-2fimages-2f874072b7-2398-44c1-b067-eb2020a06f2b_894x570.jpg",William M.

They're the new normal.,,"Dear Bankless Nation If you were on Crypto Twitter during the holidays, you may have noticed how 2021 ended in perfect crypto fashion: heated debate. Rather than being about Alt L1’s vs Ethereum L2’s, this time it was about the legitimacy of Web3. And instead of two factions of the crypto industry going head to head, it was Jack Dorsey versus the VCs. Lighting the Match Things started with Jack Dorsey retweeting a meme about how Web3 is funneling all its value into the mouths of Silicon Valley VCs while leaving just mere droplets for retail investors. The critique is that early seed rounds for ‘Web3’ investments are dominated by privileged VCs, and leave little to nothing for retail investors. This means that, if retail investors want a piece of these Web3 platforms, they’ll need to be buying them from the VC funds that were able to get early access to discounted valuations. Jack thinks that this dynamic invalidates the power of Web3. If Web3 protocols are owned by VCs, then it’s not Web3 at all, according to Jack. I’ve seen this sentiment echoed elsewhere as well, so it’s not just Jack. To some, ‘Web3’ is a marketing term that VCs are capitalizing on for short-term flips. VCs are investing in hype—not substance—and then using that hype to turn around and dump their bags on retail investors who don’t have the same access to Web3 investments. I’m sure there’s some truth to this. The hype around Web3 is significant . A16z has even sponsored a public opinion survey to gauge people’s opinions of the term ‘Web3’. Spoiler: people like it. So are VC’s capitalizing on this by front-running retail into seed rounds? Will the future of Web3 be forever delegitimized because of this? Or is something entirely different happening? Let’s unpack.

For reference, the retroactive airdrop included over 250,000 unique addresses on Ethereum.Uniswap kicked off the Retroactive Airdrop movement, and hundreds of retroactive airdrops have happened since then, distributing billions of dollars in capital to hundreds of thousands of unique individuals who have interacted with some crypto-app in some capacity.The Uniswap Series A seed round raised $11m and was led by a16z, with other VCs also participating in the round.Ask yourself: Did the Uniswap airdrop increase or decrease the value of the seed investments that these VC firms made in Uniswap? I would argue that the increased distribution and significant retail ownership over Uniswap added orders of magnitude more value to the investments made by VC firms.Value arises from aligned incentives, and the Uniswap scenario illustrates how it is economically rational for VCs to fairly engage and distribute capital to retail investors. The Uniswap airdrop gave free capital to 250,000 unique Ethereum addresses, while simultaneously providing a liquidity event for the early VCs.Not all Web3 investments have the same elegant outcome that Uniswap did, however. Some are even better.ENSThe Ethereum Name service airdropped 50% of the total supply of ENS to its users, with the other 50% being distributed to ~500 early contributors and ecosystem players to the project.The 50% community treasury is ignored; it’s controlled by the other half of the tokens.ENS never raised a dime from VCs. If any funds want ENS exposure, they’re going to have to buy it from the hands of the ENS users.CoinbaseWeb3 has shifted the Overton window of capital distribution so well that it’s impacted the traditional equity markets.When Coinbase had its direct listing of COIN into public markets, it airdropped 100 shares to each of its 1,700 employees. With COIN opening at $250 per share, it was a  $25,000 “thank you” to every Coinbase employee.When’s the last time a traditional company gifted its employees equity? This is the culture that is being exported by crypto to the rest of the world.Web3: A Work In ProgressThe above examples are perhaps some of the best that Web3 has to offer. There are plenty of other examples that aren’t this good, and even more that are unfavorable to retail investors. And, of course, plenty that don’t even consider retail investors at all.But, we have to remember what the paradigm was before Web3 ever came around.Retail never had an opportunity at all, anywhere, ever. Crypto has always been about giving everyone an equal footing on everything. One of the big driving forces behind the 2017 mania was that retail investors could ‘get in’ before any of the institutions. This has been true about Bitcoin in 2010, Ethereum in 2015, and is still very true about many of the Web3 platforms being built today.Prior to crypto, retail investors would have to wait for companies like Twitter to publically list on the NASDAQ or NYSE. Then, finally, retail investors could buy these companies via their brokerages from the VC funds that lead the Series A, B, C, D, E… of the now public companies.With Web3, VC’s have to pay money to get what is given out to users for free. VC’s pay money, users receive capital.This is the paradigm shift that Web3 is bringing to the world. It’s not black and white, but these are the new incentives that rule the land.Follow the IncentivesJack’s follow-up tweet talked about how the incentives of VC firms will corrupt Web3.“You don’t own “web3.” The VCs and their LPs do. It will never escape their incentives.”All the biggest airdrops that have happened have been the ones that have disproportionately rewarded users in the cap table. I believe Jack doesn’t understand the alignment between VCs and retail investors that Web3 brings to the table.Web3 platforms that put ownership into the hands of the community are the ones that succeed. The Web3 platforms depend on community ownership. Without community ownership and involvement, then it’s not Web3 at all.If you believe my claim above then significant inclusion of retail investors via airdrops or other methods is economically rational for VC firms to consider. Web3 platforms that give ownership are going to succeed versus ones that don’t. Therefore, VCs need to be considering retail inclusion when placing their investments.It’s not VC incentives that are the issue, Jack is just stuck inside of a Web2 paradigm. And that’s fine!Raising capital and liquidity through community is a novel paradigm and crypto hasn’t figured out best practices yet. Uniswap kicked it off, but the “how” continues to evolve.However, I can’t help but photoshop his meme into two versions that I think more accurately reflect reality:Follow the Incentives Part 2What about Jack’s incentives? Why is he so loudly grieving about Web3?It’s no secret that the only thing inside of crypto that Jack cares about is Bitcoin. He’s frequently discredited anything about crypto that’s not Bitcoin, and now it’s Web3’s turn I guess.I think Jack has it out for Web3 because he, like many Bitcoiners, thinks that the only truly decentralized thing is Bitcoin, and everything else is decentralization theater. He’s trying to manifest this fake, twisted version of Web3 by magnifying its flaws and ignoring its merits.He’s trying to meme this corrupted version of Web3 into reality so that he can dance on its grave.I see Jack both in denial about the realities of Web3, and also projecting his Web2 mindset upon an entire industry. Sadly, there’s always a basal level of anti-crypto sentiment in the world at all times, that a leader like Jack can drum up enough vitriol in order to legitimize the critiques.What about US-Accredited Investor Regulations?The fact that Jack Dorsey doesn’t bring up the terrible accredited investor regulations while critiquing Web3 speaks volumes.It’s not like Web3 startups want to take money from VC firms. They’re forced to, because the SEC doesn’t allow unaccredited investors to invest in private securities. That’s why it’s so difficult to find ways to include retail investors, even when Web3 platforms badly desire to do so.Web3 is supposed to be owned and operated by its users. It’s the SEC that’s preventing this reality from manifesting, not VCs.

Then, finally, retail investors could buy these companies via their brokerages from the VC funds that lead the Series A, B, C, D, E… of the now public companies.With Web3, VC’s have to pay money to get what is given out to users for free. VC’s pay money, users receive capital.This is the paradigm shift that Web3 is bringing to the world. It’s not black and white, but these are the new incentives that rule the land.Follow the IncentivesJack’s follow-up tweet talked about how the incentives of VC firms will corrupt Web3.“You don’t own “web3.” The VCs and their LPs do. It will never escape their incentives.”All the biggest airdrops that have happened have been the ones that have disproportionately rewarded users in the cap table. I believe Jack doesn’t understand the alignment between VCs and retail investors that Web3 brings to the table.Web3 platforms that put ownership into the hands of the community are the ones that succeed. The Web3 platforms depend on community ownership. Without community ownership and involvement, then it’s not Web3 at all.If you believe my claim above then significant inclusion of retail investors via airdrops or other methods is economically rational for VC firms to consider. Web3 platforms that give ownership are going to succeed versus ones that don’t. Therefore, VCs need to be considering retail inclusion when placing their investments.It’s not VC incentives that are the issue, Jack is just stuck inside of a Web2 paradigm. And that’s fine!Raising capital and liquidity through community is a novel paradigm and crypto hasn’t figured out best practices yet. Uniswap kicked it off, but the “how” continues to evolve.However, I can’t help but photoshop his meme into two versions that I think more accurately reflect reality:Follow the Incentives Part 2What about Jack’s incentives? Why is he so loudly grieving about Web3?It’s no secret that the only thing inside of crypto that Jack cares about is Bitcoin. He’s frequently discredited anything about crypto that’s not Bitcoin, and now it’s Web3’s turn I guess.I think Jack has it out for Web3 because he, like many Bitcoiners, thinks that the only truly decentralized thing is Bitcoin, and everything else is decentralization theater. He’s trying to manifest this fake, twisted version of Web3 by magnifying its flaws and ignoring its merits.He’s trying to meme this corrupted version of Web3 into reality so that he can dance on its grave.I see Jack both in denial about the realities of Web3, and also projecting his Web2 mindset upon an entire industry. Sadly, there’s always a basal level of anti-crypto sentiment in the world at all times, that a leader like Jack can drum up enough vitriol in order to legitimize the critiques.What about US-Accredited Investor Regulations?The fact that Jack Dorsey doesn’t bring up the terrible accredited investor regulations while critiquing Web3 speaks volumes.It’s not like Web3 startups want to take money from VC firms. They’re forced to, because the SEC doesn’t allow unaccredited investors to invest in private securities. That’s why it’s so difficult to find ways to include retail investors, even when Web3 platforms badly desire to do so.Web3 is supposed to be owned and operated by its users. It’s the SEC that’s preventing this reality from manifesting, not VCs. Jack didn’t mention this anywhere.I see this as evidence that unfairly Jack has it out for Web3, and is spreading misinformation and falsities in order to create a narrative that answers to Jack’s cognitive dissonance about being a Bitcoin maxi.¯\_(ツ)_/¯- DavidP.S. let’s not forget where the Web3 movement started from:",https://www.bankless.com/what-jack-dorsey-doesnt-get-about,2022-01-03T00:00:00.000Z,"https://bankless.ghost.io/content/images/image/fetch/w_1200,h_600,c_limit,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https-3a-2f-2fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com-2fpublic-2fimages-2f6cc9385f-1eb0-4810-a82b-bcc2b82456a0_2762x1016.jpg",David Hoffman,Bankless,blog,,Unknown Error

Zenlink has already launched several giveaway events till now, and rewards for the giveaways held prior to the launch of Zenlink have all been distributed. There will be more events in the future, stay tuned!Locking in DOT/KSM through Zenlink SlotVault to support Zenlink's partner bid slots will complete a portion of the ZLK distribution in that session. The benefit to users is the ability to receive both token distributions from parachain projects bidding for slots and ZLK airdrops. (Ended)Participate in ZLK liquidity mining, trading mining (Paused), and invite to earn (Paused). 50% of ZLK tokens will be distributed to the community, which will be done through liquidity mining, trading mining, etc.Join the Zenlink DAO Governance Organization. ZenlinkDAO bootstrapping governance has been launched and ZenlinkDAO governance board members can make suggestions on Zenlink's development plans and participate in ZLK liquidity mining in the early stages.

By accessing the ultimate, open, and universal cross-chain DEX protocol based on Substrate, Zenlink DEX Protocol enables all parachains to build DEX and achieve liquidity sharing in one click. Zenlink DEX Protocol includes Module, WASM, and EVM implementations, which are flexible and adaptable, allowing for customizable compositions and interoperability with different DeFi modules. In addition, the Zenlink DEX Aggregator connects all DEX DApps on Polkadot and aggregates liquidity, providing a low slippage trading experience for users. Zenlink DEX Composable Hub enables developers to access the Zenlink DEX Module to build their own unique DEXs, forming a DEX composable hub for the Polkadot ecosystem. Zenlink DEX Network architecture can be described as follows.Zenlink DEX Protocol is an underlying cross-chain DEX protocol based on Substrate, which includes Module, WASM, and EVM implementations. Zenlink DEX Module is a module that can be inserted into parachain code through Pallet. The module will be integrated into parachains, so that they can directly have the basic functions of DEX without repeated development, such as Swap, creating transaction pairs, adding/removing liquidity, etc.; at the same time, it can also share liquidity with all parachains integrated with Zenlink DEX Module. Zenlink DEX WASM refers to the version of the WASM contract written with ink! Pallet. The advantage of this implementation is that the smart contract can be compiled and deployed to the parachain ink! module, instead of modifying the source code of the parachain. WASM is the native contract implementation in the Polkadot network and is the primary contract deployment method of the future, and the Zenlink DEX WASM version has the ability to be deployed to the WASM contract parachain for the first time. Zenlink DEX EVM is a contractual deployment mode to achieve compatibility with the Ethereum virtual machine (EVM), and it is also a transition scheme adopted by the Polkadot network in the initial stage. The Zenlink DEX EVM version implements all the functions of the protocol layer, complements the perfect testing process, and can be deployed to the EVM contract parachain for the first time, which greatly expands the applicability of the platform. Zenlink DApp is a front-end interactive product based on Zenlink DEX Protocol to facilitate users to use cross-chain DEX without awareness. Zenlink Network Token (ZLK) is the native token of the Zenlink network, serving the participants of the entire Zenlink DEX network. It provides a fair and transparent governance mechanism and significant utility within the ecosystem, and is used to motivate eco-users to participate in the network development in the long term.Zenlink Network EcosystemZenlink network ecosystem participants consist of the following categories. Liquidity providers: provides liquidity for trading pairs on the Zenlink DEX network. Traders: users who make trades on Zenlink DEX. Governance users: users who obtain ZLK and participate in network governance in a variety of ways. Developers: developers involved in the Zenlink network. Parachains: parachains integrating Zenlink DEX Module Zenlink is committed to providing valuable protocols, products, and services, and the development of its ecosystem depends on the joint efforts of the above participants. At the same time, Zenlink will continue to invest the value created by the network into ecosystem construction, encourage more contributors to participate in network construction, promote optimization and upgrading at all levels of the network, and then create greater value, making the whole network enter the development track of positive feedback. And ZLK is the most important medium to promote the whole eco-economic cycle.Token UtilityThe native cryptographically-secured fungible protocol token of Zenlink (ticker symbol ZLK) is a transferable representation of attributed governance and utility functions specified in the protocol/code of Zenlink, and which is designed to be used solely as an interoperable utility token thereon.ZLK provides the economic incentives which will be distributed to encourage users to exert efforts towards contribution and participation in the ecosystem on Zenlink, thereby creating a mutually beneficial system where every participant is fairly compensated for its efforts. ZLK is an integral and indispensable part of Zenlink, because without ZLK, there would be no incentive for users to expend resources to participate in activities or provide services for the benefit of the entire ecosystem on Zenlink. Given that additional ZLK will be awarded to a user based only on its actual usage, activity and efforts made on Zenlink and/or proportionate to the frequency and volume of transactions, users of Zenlink and/or holders of ZLK which did not actively participate will not receive any ZLK incentives.ZLK does not in any way represent any shareholding, participation, right, title, or interest in the Company, the Distributor, their respective affiliates, or any other company, enterprise or undertaking, nor will ZLK entitle token holders to any promise of fees, dividends, revenue, profits or investment returns, and are not intended to constitute securities in Singapore or any relevant jurisdiction. ZLK may only be utilised on Zenlink, and ownership of ZLK carries no rights, express or implied, other than the right to use ZLK as a means to enable usage of and interaction within Zenlink.ZLK is a utility token with multiple practical utility values, including:1. Trading mining weight value bonusZLK functions as a loyalty membership point which embeds a licence granting active participants exclusive access to selected products or services, so users will be classified into different loyalty tiers based on the amount of ZLK held, user activity and volume of transactions, with each variable weighted based on the ""tradingContributionValue"" formula. The premium membership tiers would allow users to get greater access to the network features and more preferential terms. The calculation formula for trading mining is as follows:tradingContributionValue=d×r×tradingVolume0.8tradingContributionValue=d×r×tradingVolume^{0.8}tradingContributionValue=d×r×tradingVolume0.8reward=m×(tradingContributionValuetotalTradingContributionValue)reward=m×(\frac{tradingContributionValue}{totalTradingContributionValue})reward=m×(totalTradingContributionValuetradingContributionValue​)d_ weight value of the ZLK holdings, see the table below for detailsr_ trading pair weight value, see the table below for detailsm_ indicates the total incentives in the periodtradingVolume_ indicates the amount of a single trade, denominated in stablecoinsNote: tradingVolume does not count all transactions. Every 5 minutes will be a statistical period, for each address, only the one with the highest transaction volume within 5 minutes will be counted, the rest of the transactions will not be counted. If there are multiple transactions with the same maximum value at the same address within 5 minutes, only one transaction will be counted. For example: If address A has 3 transactions in 5 minutes, 100 USDT, 1,000 USDT, and 10,000 USDT respectively, then its tradingVolume is 10,000 USDT and tradingContributionValue is 100 in these 5 minutes. Similarly, if address B has 2 transactions in 5 minutes, 5,000 USDT, and 50,000 USDT respectively, then its tradingVolume is 50,000 USDT and tradingContributionValue is 223.61 in these 5 minutes2. Active User IncentivesUsers may receive ZLK rewards by actively participating in activities on Zenlink, for example utilising the platform, providing liquidity, or participating in governance.3. GovernanceTo promote decentralized community governance for the network, ZLK would allow holders to initiate and vote on ZIP (Zenlink Improve Proposal) to determine future features and/or parameters of Zenlink, with voting weight calculated in proportion to the tokens staked (the right to vote is restricted solely to voting on features of Zenlink; it does not entitle ZLK holders to vote on the operation and management of the Company, its affiliates, or their assets or the disposition of such assets to token holders, or select the board of directors of these entities, or determine the development direction of these entities, does not constitute any equity interest in any of these entities or any collective investment scheme; the arrangement is not intended to be any form of joint venture or partnership). For example, ZLK holders may vote on suggestions for the improvement of Zenlink products, allocatn of the treasury to development or community building efforts.Economic MechanismIn order to promote network growth and ensure a healthy cycle of the entire ecosystem, Zenlink designed the following economic mechanisms for ZLK: Liquidity MiningZenlink is currently a DEX based on AMM (automatic market maker) model. It is crucial for DEXs to have a broad and deep liquidity pool in order to create markets for users to trade their tokens, so Zenlink has established a liquidity incentive program. Token holders can obtain the LP Token of the corresponding trading pair by providing liquidity to the Zenlink DEX network. The LP Token represents the voucher to add and remove liquidity, and liquidity incentives can be obtained by staking LP Token with Zenlink to record their contribution to the liquidity pool, and accordingly the liquidity provider will be entitled to receive ZLK rewards. The liquidity mining reward shall be distributed periodically, as detailed in the announcement or program of liquidity mining launched in the future. It is important to reiterate that a liquidity pool simply comprises a set of autonomous smart contracts deployed on the relevant blockchain network, operated directly by users calling functions on it (which allows them to interact with other users and/or pool their own selected assets in a peer-to-peer manner). There is no further control by or interaction with the original entity which had deployed the smart contract (which entity solely functions as a provider of technical tools for users, and is not offering any sort of securities product or regulated service).Trading MiningUsers who trade with DEX can also get ZLK token incentives proportionate to their activity. Considering the fairness of participating users, there will be a balance between users with different trading volumes in the design of the mechanism. The incentive for transaction mining comes from two parts: 10% of the transaction fee income (rebate) and 15% of the initial ZLK allocation. The reward is distributed according to the proportion of the contribution value of the transaction volume in a certain period, calculation formula reference [Token Utility-Trading mining weight value bonus].Transaction Fee Fund PoolThe transaction fee will be managed in a dedicated fund pool. At present, the maximum transaction fee is 0.3% of the amount of each transaction, and depending on the actual situation, the transaction fee charged on different parachains may be in different tokens, so there are theoretically multiple tokens in the transaction fee fund pool. The main uses of transaction fees include: ZLK liquidity provider share: 50% Active user incentives: 30% Traders share: 10%Reservation share: 10%Community Incentives PoolUsers may receive ZLK rewards by actively participating in activities on Zenlink, for example utilising the platform, providing liquidity, or participating in governance. 5% of the total supply of ZLK tokens is reserved to reward active community contributors and parachains that promote adoption by integrating Zenlink DEX Module.DAO TreasuryThis part of the token is reserved for 5% of the total supply and is jointly managed by DAO members to support the development of the Zenlink network. Its expenditure purposes include, but are not limited to: Zenlink marketing or community-building activities. Rewards to DAO members based on the proof of workload.Developer Grant.*We will publish a separate document on the model design of Zenlink NFTZLK DistributionZenlink will issue the same set of ZLK Token in Kusama Network and Polkadot Network with a maximum supply of 100 million. Due to the buyback mechanism, there will be a certain degree of deflation, and the actual maximum circulation will be less than 100 million. The token distribution ratio of the two networks is tentatively 40% of Kusama issuance and 60% of Polkadot issuance, following the same distribution rules (i.e. 40,000,000 ZLK issued on the Kusama network and 60,000,000 ZLK issued on the Polkadot network, which will follow a non-discriminatory release rule). The specific distribution is as follows: Community: 50%, of which: Trading mining: 15%, non-linear unlockedLiquidity mining: 25%, non-linear unlockedDAO Treasury: 5%, used on demand for network construction expenses and is jointly controlled by the community and Zenlink team. Community Incentives: 5%, which is used to reward ZLK active community contributors and parachains that integrate Zenlink DEX Module.Early investors: 26%, of which:Seed round: 7%, linearly unlocked every 3 months, 1/8 unlocked each timeAngel round: 11%, linearly unlocked every 2 months, 1/8 unlocked each time Series A Round: 8%, linearly unlocked every month, 1/8 unlocked each timeTeam: 20%, linearly unlocked every 3 months and released in 24 months (No unlocking for the first 2 months after launch). Zenlink Foundation: 4%, reserved and there is no plan to unlock for now.Risk Statement Zenlink is currently in the initial development stages and there are a variety of unforeseeable risks. You acknowledge and agree that there are numerous risks associated with acquiring ZLK, holding ZLK, and using ZLK for participation in Zenlink. In the worst scenario, this could lead to the loss of all or part of ZLK held. IF YOU DECIDE TO ACQUIRE ZLK OR PARTICIPATE IN ZENLINK, YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE, ACCEPT AND ASSUME THE FOLLOWING RISKS:Uncertain Regulations and Enforcement Actions: The regulatory status of Zenlink, ZLK and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. The regulation of digital assets has become a primary target of regulation in all major countries in the world. It is impossible to predict how, when or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulations or create new regulations with respect to such technology and its applications, including ZLK and/or Zenlink. Regulatory actions could negatively impact ZLK and/or Zenlink in various ways. The Company, the Distributor (or their respective affiliates) may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction.Inadequate disclosure of information: As at the date hereof, Zenlink is still under development and its design concepts, consensus mechanisms, algorithms, codes, and other technical details and parameters may be constantly and frequently updated and changed. Although this Lightpaper contains the most current information relating to Zenlink, it is not absolutely complete and may still be adjusted and updated by the Zenlink team from time to time. The Zenlink team has neither the ability nor obligation to keep holders of ZLK informed of every detail (including development progress and expected milestones) regarding the project to develop Zenlink, hence insufficient information disclosure is inevitable and reasonable.Competitors: Various types of decentralised applications and networks are emerging at a rapid rate, and the industry is increasingly competitive. It is possible that alternative networks could be established that utilise the same or similar code and protocol underlying ZLK and/or Zenlink and attempt to re-create similar facilities. Zenlink may be required to compete with these alternative networks, which could negatively impact ZLK and/or Zenlink.Loss of Talent: The development of Zenlink greatly depends on the continued co-operation of the existing technical team and expert consultants, who are highly knowledgeable and experienced in their respective sectors. The loss of any member may adversely affect Zenlink or its future development. Further, stability and cohesion within the team is critical to the overall development of Zenlink. There is the possibility that conflict within the team and/or departure of core personnel may occur, resulting in negative influence on the project in the future.Failure to develop: There is the risk that the development of Zenlink will not be executed or implemented as planned, for a variety of reasons, including without limitation the event of a decline in the prices of any digital asset, virtual currency or ZLK, unforeseen technical difficulties, and shortage of development funds for activities.Security weaknesses: Hackers or other malicious groups or organisations may attempt to interfere with ZLK and/or Zenlink in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing. Furthermore, there is a risk that a third party or a member of the Company, the Distributor or their respective affiliates may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses into the core infrastructure of ZLK and/or Zenlink, which could negatively affect ZLK and/or Zenlink. Further, the future of cryptography and security innovations are highly unpredictable and advances in cryptography, or technical advances (including without limitation development of quantum computing), could present unknown risks to ZLK and/or Zenlink by rendering ineffective the cryptographic consensus mechanism that underpins that blockchain protocol.Other risks: In addition, the potential risks briefly mentioned above are not exhaustive and there are other risks (as more particularly set out in the Terms and Conditions) associated with your participation in Zenlink, as well as acquisition of, holding and use of ZLK, including those that the Company or the Distributor cannot anticipate. Such risks may further materialise as unanticipated variations or combinations of the aforementioned risks. You should conduct full due diligence on the Company, the Distributor, their respective affiliates, and the Zenlink team, as well as understand the overall framework, mission and vision for Zenlink prior to participating in the same and/or acquiring ZLK.AnnexesZenlink_Tokenomics_Page.pdf4MBPDF",Tokenomics,https://app.gitbook.com/share/space/thumbnail/-Mcs9C52G4j4nqQnKPYa/page/-MkLRapVqe6J0mDKD0pN.png?color=%23F20082&logo=https%3A%2F%2F2537315574-files.gitbook.io%2F~%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252F-Mcs9C52G4j4nqQnKPYa%252Ficon%252FAVJMkk0gwqKPRK2G9BO5%252F%25E8%25B5%2584%25E6%25BA%2590%252064.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D0d25952d-7e2e-4976-a97a-4e51a79cd11a&theme=default,https://wiki.zenlink.pro/resources/tokenomics,Zenlink,docs,DEX composable hub between all Polkadot parachains.,"zenlink, resources, tokenomics","Dex, Decentralized exchange, DeFi",Unknown Error,{}

It enables borrowing with minimum collateralization as low as 105% and margin trading with up to 20X leverage. The innovative design of Equilibrium's bailout mechanism for liquidations that is low friction and does not need auctions allows for the introduction of the first fully on-chain order book based  decentralized exchange with high leverage. Here is what sets Equilibrium apart from other well-known known DeFi protocols: There are no arbitrary governance-set interest rates. They are determined by a borrower’s portfolio, borrower debt, overall system liquidity, and the market's risks and dynamics. There are no arbitrarily set LTV requirements. The system makes sure every position remains solvent at a 100% collateralization ratio. There are no arbitrarily set liquidation penalties, and no hidden fees when borrowers default on their loan. Most loans in popular money markets (AAVE and Compound) are taken in major stablecoins for new investment opportunities. But users need to switch to other applications as there is no trading functionality on the initial platforms. Equilibrium solves this problem efficiently The Equilibrium assets module supports: 1. asset lending. 2. fractional reserve system and synthetic asset creation. 3. an exchange that lets users engage in leveraged trading. 4. portfolio hedging. The Assets module logic lets Equilibrium introduce a broad line of DeFi products within one blockchain, practically out of the box. The thought-out design of Polkadot’s consensus and finality mechanisms guarantees the security of the Equilibrium substrate on the blockchain level. Approximately 10 collators manage the Equilibrium parachain with a POA consensus and shared GRANDPA finality and blockchain security provided out of the box by Polkadot. Equilibrium achieves cross-chain compatibility by way of Polkadot’s integration of third party bridges to different blockchains. Ecosystem-wide interoperability is further achieved with the help of the Polkadot's XCM protocol.","Equilibrium parachainEquilibrium introduces the first DeFi 2.0 protocol on Polkadot with novel on-chain approach to risk and pricing for asset portfolios.

Most loans in popular money markets (AAVE and Compound) are taken in major stablecoins for new investment opportunities. But users need to switch to other applications as there is no trading functionality on the initial platforms. Equilibrium solves this problem efficiently

The Equilibrium assets module supports:

1.asset lending.2.fractional reserve system and synthetic asset creation.3.an exchange that lets users engage in leveraged trading.4.portfolio hedging.

The Assets module logic lets Equilibrium introduce a broad line of DeFi products within one blockchain, practically out of the box.

The thought-out design of Polkadot’s consensus and finality mechanisms guarantees the security of the Equilibrium substrate on the blockchain level. Approximately 10 collators manage the Equilibrium parachain with a POA consensus and shared GRANDPA finality and blockchain security provided out of the box by Polkadot.

Equilibrium achieves cross-chain compatibility by way of Polkadot’s integration of third party bridges to different blockchains. Ecosystem-wide interoperability is further achieved with the help of the Polkadot's XCM protocol.",Equilibrium Overview,https://app.gitbook.com/share/space/thumbnail/-MK_3P6RnPHvv_Gsa_wJ/page/-MKeVpT1BAxVHHuF-5zo.png?color=%231792FF&logo=https%3A%2F%2F3730882694-files.gitbook.io%2F~%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252F-MK_3P6RnPHvv_Gsa_wJ%252Flogo%252FmIhcme1Z5TRtISM4wGBm%252FEQ.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D92da9bdb-93da-4d3c-92c7-9088efa5d6f7&theme=default,https://docs.equilibrium.io/equilibrium-overview,EQ Finance,docs,The first interest-bearing stablecoin backed by LSTs on Polkadot. ,"equilibrium, equilibrium overview","DeFi, Stablecoin",Unknown Error,{}

Now that you know how liquidity gets into Equilibrium, let's talk about use cases Equilibrium offers for liquidity holders. BorrowingYou may borrow assets in Equilibrium in a collateralised fashion. There are no per-asset debt ""positions,"" and Equilibrium treats your assets and liabilities as a complete portfolio. 

If the value of your assets exceeds the value of your liabilities, you're safe as a borrower and are not subject to liquidation. Liquidation is a simple balance purge where all of your assets and liabilities are transferred to insurance pool as described in Margining section. 

The interest you pay depends on your portfolio risk and the portfolio collateralization levels we talked about in the Interest Rate Model section. Interest is payable in EQ tokens, and when you don't have a sufficient EQ token balance, the system will automatically sell your collateral to pay interest fees, so make sure you always have enough EQ liquidity to avoid unnecessary swaps.  LendingYou may lend assets in Equilibrium and earn interest for doing so. The beauty of lending assets via Equilibrium comes from the fact that lenders transfer the liquidation risk to the insurers. When borrowers default, system transfers their debt to insurers, once insurers cover liquidated debt,  lenders are able to redeem their liquidity back.The protocol does not guarantee liquidity, instead it relies on the interest rate model to incentivise it. In periods of extreme demand for an asset, the liquidity of the protocol (the tokens available to withdraw or borrow) will decline; when this occur, interest rates rise, incentivising supply, and disincentivizing borrowing. An exampleConsider the following BTC borrow + liquidation example (1 BTC = 20 ETH for simplicity's sake). 1. Initial stateWe have two bailsmen, two borrowers, and one lender in our simple example. The Lendable column shows the total number of tokens in the system available for lending. AssetBailsman1Bailsman2Borrower1Borrower2LendableBTC500010ETH0100100002. Borrower1 borrows 5 BTC (transfers 5 BTC to Borrower2) from LenderAssetBailsman1Bailsman2Borrower1Borrower2LendableBTC50-5510ETH0100100003. Borrower defaultsSince we have set 1 BTC = 20 ETH, bailsmen have equal value of liquidity and thus split Borrower1's debt and collateral evenly:AssetBailsman1Bailsman2Borrower1Borrower2LendableBTC2.5-2.50510ETH50150000Notice that following invariant holds inside Equilibrium: Total Collateral−Total Debt=CONSTTotal\ Collateral - Total\ Debt = CONSTTotal Collateral−Total Debt=CONSTWhere: Total Collateral = Total Borrower Collateral + Total Bailsman Collateral + Total Master Account balance + Total LendableTotal Debt = Total Borrower Debt + Total Bailsman DebtThe difference between the above two aggregates is the amount of physical asset brought into the system. When user borrows X amount of an asset from the lending pool the following checks happen: X + Total Debt <= Total LendableX + Total Debt <= Total Collateral - Total Debt Interest ratesThe interest that borrowers pay gets redistributed among bailsmen and lenders. The following breakdown applies: Interest rate componentValue Base Lender Rate0.5% APRBase Insurance Rate1.0% APRBase Treasury Rate1.0% APRPrimary Borrower Rate ~ Leverage * VolatilityLender share30% of Primary Borrower RateBailsman share70% of Primary Borrower Rate So the minimum possible interest rate borrowers pay is 2.5% APR, while the biggest contributor to the final interest rate figure is the Primary Borrower Rate which depends on the leverage the borrower undertakes and the risk (volatility) of the borrower portfolio. 30% of the Primary Borrower Rate is funnelled to lenders, while 70% is funnelled to insurers (bailsmen). InsuranceBailsmen provide liquidity in advance to cover for borrower liquidations. When borrowers default on their loans, their collateral and debt get distributed among bailsmen on a pro-rata basis. The only way bailsmen are able to get negative balances (liabilities) is through borrower liquidation. Bailsmen receive 5% extra reward in a form of borrower collateral which borrowers pay as a penalty (see Margining section for details) 

Bailsmen are the keepers of the system. They make sure it stays solvent all the time, and receive interest rewards for bearing liquidation risks. 70% of the interest rate that the system collects from borrowers goes to the bailsmen. The other 30% is funnelled to Lenders. Margin tradingOur interoperable DeFi platform allows for leveraged trades on margin up to 20% (5x leverage).Support of different assetsEquilibrium has the capability to go beyond the limits of current Ethereum-based decentralized exchanges. There is opportunity to add tokens from the Polkadot ecosystem (as well as from other blockchains) to the exchange. In doing so, the traded pairs on Equilibrium's DEX will not be limited to ERC-20 tokens (as it would be elsewhere), but can land on any blockchain that can be connected to the Polkadot ecosystem.High leverageEquilibrium’s approach to modeling collateralized loans allows for competitively low levels of collateralization of user portfolios. This means that high leverage is achievable.DEXBuilding an on-chain decentralized exchange where all orders interact directly with each other on-chain achieves extensive decentralisation, but leads to horrible user experience. All the transactions are expensive and slow, as users pay fees and wait for transactions to mine. Paying for placing, cancelling and modifying an order is plain terrible approach to building DeFi for people and should be avoided at all costs. 

Off-chain order books, where market-makers broadcast orders to be filled on-chain, partially solve the problems of the on-chain order books (as outlined above), but have several issues of their own:Front-running: MMs, validators/off-chain workers get to see orders before they get mined.Trade failures: for example, an order is visible in the order book while pending settlement at the same time (the transaction is being mined).Cancellation: Users need to pay transaction fees to cancel an order, updating an order becomes expensive. Furthermore, there's no support for complex order types.  Scalability of substrate and Polkadot technology let Equilibrium overcome these issues. There’s no mining involved, and consensus is reached much faster in Polkadot compared to Ethereum, for example.Furthermore, designated off-chain workers and unsigned transactions can potentially make traders’ lives easier, as they allow for the separation of trade matching and settlement. This would let users place numerous orders without paying transaction fees, allow for trades to be dispatched to blockchain in batches, further improving the scalability and the speed of the DEX. Equilibrium currently runs fully on-chain order book DEX where users pay transaction fees for placing orders, cancelling orders and marking trades. Moving order book off-chain is something that needs to be thoroughly analysed in terms of implications and should involve governance discussion and decision.",Use Cases,https://app.gitbook.com/share/space/thumbnail/-MK_3P6RnPHvv_Gsa_wJ/page/-MK_5JlMnXuch_CiexRN.png?color=%231792FF&logo=https%3A%2F%2F3730882694-files.gitbook.io%2F~%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252F-MK_3P6RnPHvv_Gsa_wJ%252Flogo%252FmIhcme1Z5TRtISM4wGBm%252FEQ.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D92da9bdb-93da-4d3c-92c7-9088efa5d6f7&theme=default,https://docs.equilibrium.io/under-the-hood/use-cases,EQ Finance,docs,The first interest-bearing stablecoin backed by LSTs on Polkadot. ,"equilibrium, under the hood, use cases","DeFi, Stablecoin",Unknown Error,{}

The only way bailsmen are able to get negative balances (liabilities) is through borrower liquidation. Bailsmen receive 5% extra reward in a form of borrower collateral which borrowers pay as a penalty (see Margining section for details) 

Bailsmen are the keepers of the system. They make sure it stays solvent all the time, and receive interest rewards for bearing liquidation risks. 70% of the interest rate that the system collects from borrowers goes to the bailsmen.

There are two ways to get liquidity inside Equilibrium: Users who have EQ tokens allocations may use them as insurance liquidity or collateral. Lending of EQ tokens is prohibited at the moment. Users who want to be borrowers/lenders/insurers in the Equilibrium ecosystem can bring other crypto assets into our parachain via different Polkadot bridges and the XCM BridgesBridges are secure communication protocols between two different blockchains: Bitcoin, Ethereum, BSC, Cosmos, Solana, and many more are all compatible with Polkadot and Equilibrium. 

Equilibrium integrates ChainBridge as a means for communicating with the Ethereum and ETH-like blockchains. Thanks to Chainbridge modules, users will be able to deposit assets from Ethereum, BSC, HECO, Polygon networks to Equilibrium, as well as bridge EQ tokens from Equilibrium into all of these blockchain.  However, more trusted solution is ultimately needed. Unfortunately there is no native bridge solution in the ecosystem at the moment, so the option Equilibrium has on the table is to integrate with bridges supported by Moonbeam parachain. Moonbeam is an EVM chain which supports EVM to EVM bridging working with several well known bridges: Celer, Synapse, Axelar, Multichain, LayerZero. The typical bridging process may look something very similar to the following:A user locks his assets in the smart contract on the source blockchain. He specifies a destination blockchain and address where he wants to receive a wrapped representation of his assets.Relayers (third parties who run bridging software in a decentralized fashion) process the corresponding user transaction and reach consensus on minting assets to a user's address in the destination blockchain. Unwrapping and receiving assets on the native blockchain works same way, but in opposite direction.From the user perspective, it's a matter of sending for example ETH to the designated Ethereum address, then waiting a period of time for inclusion and finality confirmation, given different the specifics of different blockchains.  Now that you know how liquidity gets into Equilibrium, let's talk about use cases Equilibrium offers for liquidity holders. BorrowingYou may borrow assets in Equilibrium in a collateralised fashion. There are no per-asset debt ""positions,"" and Equilibrium treats your assets and liabilities as a complete portfolio. 

If the value of your assets exceeds the value of your liabilities, you're safe as a borrower and are not subject to liquidation. Liquidation is a simple balance purge where all of your assets and liabilities are transferred to insurance pool as described in Margining section. 

The interest you pay depends on your portfolio risk and the portfolio collateralization levels we talked about in the Interest Rate Model section. Interest is payable in EQ tokens, and when you don't have a sufficient EQ token balance, the system will automatically sell your collateral to pay interest fees, so make sure you always have enough EQ liquidity to avoid unnecessary swaps.  LendingYou may lend assets in Equilibrium and earn interest for doing so. The beauty of lending assets via Equilibrium comes from the fact that lenders transfer the liquidation risk to the insurers. When borrowers default, system transfers their debt to insurers, once insurers cover liquidated debt,  lenders are able to redeem their liquidity back.The protocol does not guarantee liquidity, instead it relies on the interest rate model to incentivise it. In periods of extreme demand for an asset, the liquidity of the protocol (the tokens available to withdraw or borrow) will decline; when this occur, interest rates rise, incentivising supply, and disincentivizing borrowing. An exampleConsider the following BTC borrow + liquidation example (1 BTC = 20 ETH for simplicity's sake). 1. Initial stateWe have two bailsmen, two borrowers, and one lender in our simple example. The Lendable column shows the total number of tokens in the system available for lending. AssetBailsman1Bailsman2Borrower1Borrower2LendableBTC500010ETH0100100002. Borrower1 borrows 5 BTC (transfers 5 BTC to Borrower2) from LenderAssetBailsman1Bailsman2Borrower1Borrower2LendableBTC50-5510ETH0100100003. Borrower defaultsSince we have set 1 BTC = 20 ETH, bailsmen have equal value of liquidity and thus split Borrower1's debt and collateral evenly:AssetBailsman1Bailsman2Borrower1Borrower2LendableBTC2.5-2.50510ETH50150000Notice that following invariant holds inside Equilibrium: Total Collateral−Total Debt=CONSTTotal\ Collateral - Total\ Debt = CONSTTotal Collateral−Total Debt=CONSTWhere: Total Collateral = Total Borrower Collateral + Total Bailsman Collateral + Total Master Account balance + Total LendableTotal Debt = Total Borrower Debt + Total Bailsman DebtThe difference between the above two aggregates is the amount of physical asset brought into the system. When user borrows X amount of an asset from the lending pool the following checks happen: X + Total Debt <= Total LendableX + Total Debt <= Total Collateral - Total Debt Interest ratesThe interest that borrowers pay gets redistributed among bailsmen and lenders. The following breakdown applies: Interest rate componentValue Base Lender Rate0.5% APRBase Insurance Rate1.0% APRBase Treasury Rate1.0% APRPrimary Borrower Rate ~ Leverage * VolatilityLender share30% of Primary Borrower RateBailsman share70% of Primary Borrower Rate So the minimum possible interest rate borrowers pay is 2.5% APR, while the biggest contributor to the final interest rate figure is the Primary Borrower Rate which depends on the leverage the borrower undertakes and the risk (volatility) of the borrower portfolio. 30% of the Primary Borrower Rate is funnelled to lenders, while 70% is funnelled to insurers (bailsmen).

There are several key features that distinguish Equilibrium balances module from the standard balances pallet, which we describe further in this section.

($ 6,500.00)The table above shows an account with BTC in assets having USD and ETH borrowed against it. Judging by the balance values, the collateralization is slightly less than 200% here. Accounts with liabilities are subject to margin requirements, meaning that the total value of their assets should always stay above the total value of their liabilities, otherwise they get liquidated. In theory, Equilibrium's risk and pricing model allows for margin requirement of 0% (collateral value = debt value), but due to block time and price oracle limitations in practice, we risk having untimely market data in the event of abrupt market decline. That's why we limit the critical margin to 5%, allowing 5% wiggle room for possible delays.No account can hold positive and negative balances in the same asset simultaneously. To see a positive balance in a particular asset, the user must get rid of the negative balance first, and vice versa.Lending pool Unlike Borrower or Bailsman sub-accounts lending in Equilibrium is done in a pooled manner: Liquidity providers stake assets they want to lend into asset-specific pools and earn floating interest rates when borrowers and traders borrow assets.

Deposit an asset. 2. Exchange USD (gain a negative balance in USD) for positive balance in an asset that acts as collateral.","Assets in Equilibrium""Asset"" is a generic term describing some cryptocurrency. Assets can be thought of as tokens inside the Polkadot ecosystem, at least to the extent that they also have some supply, as well as logic governing changes to this supply. Users can obtain assets on their account balance in one of the following ways:Deposit: bring assets like BTC, ETH, and ERC-20 tokens into other blockchains by way of purpose-built bridges.Claim: claim EQ tokens distributed during the token swap.Receive: someone transfers assets to user's account. Trade: exchange or swap one asset for anotherEquilibrium's assets are fundamentally different from Polkadot’s assets and currency in that we do not define mint / burn / transfer operations for them. An asset module is purely a storage of assets parameters. We have different asset types within the system:Native: EQ for Equilibrium, GENS for Genshiro - these are our native asset for respective parachains in Polkadot and Kusama. Physical: Any asset that is bridgeable into our parachain. Kusama and Polkadot based assets are available via XCM, other blockchain based assets (BTC, ETH, BNB, e.t.c.) are available via  cross-chain bridges.Synthetic: We have a native stable coin called EQD (Equilibrium dollar) which is synthetic in a sense that its supply may increase or decrease based on the demand for the stablecoin (mints and burns). LP tokens: Liquidity Pool Tokens from Curve and Yield AMMs.User BalancesThis sections covers some of the aspects of the Equilibrium design in relation to Borrowers, Insurers and Lenders, as well as briefly covers all of the places inside the protocol where users might have asset balances. Borrower and Bailsman sub-accountsEquilibrium uses the substrate balances module to store and modify user account balances. There are several key features that distinguish Equilibrium balances module from the standard balances pallet, which we describe further in this section. First of all, we have a master account in Equilibrium, which acts like a wallet and a starting entry point to our blockchain products (very similar to Polygon wallet), then each master account may have separate sub-accounts with following types: Sub-account typeDescriptionBorrowerBorrower sub-accounts are used for borrowing and trading and may have both positive balances (collateral) and negative balances (debt) BailsmanUsers must meet a minimum liquidity requirement in order to register as a bailsman. Bailsman may have a negative balances (debt or liabilities) in cases when borrowers default. Each user sub-account may hold different asset portfolios. Borrower and Bailsman sub-accounts may also have liabilities (debt), which are represented with negative balances in that corresponding asset — negative balances represent borrowed assets. Consider the following totally viable example of an account balance configuration in Equilibrium:AssetPositive BalanceNegative BalanceBTC1.51 BTC 
($ 20,000.00)0.00 BTC 
($ 0.00)ETH0.00 ETH 
($ 0.00)10.00 ETH 
($ 4,000.00)USD0.00 USD 
($ 0.00)6,500.00 USD 
($ 6,500.00)The table above shows an account with BTC in assets having USD and ETH borrowed against it. Judging by the balance values, the collateralization is slightly less than 200% here. Accounts with liabilities are subject to margin requirements, meaning that the total value of their assets should always stay above the total value of their liabilities, otherwise they get liquidated. In theory, Equilibrium's risk and pricing model allows for margin requirement of 0% (collateral value = debt value), but due to block time and price oracle limitations in practice, we risk having untimely market data in the event of abrupt market decline. That's why we limit the critical margin to 5%, allowing 5% wiggle room for possible delays.No account can hold positive and negative balances in the same asset simultaneously. To see a positive balance in a particular asset, the user must get rid of the negative balance first, and vice versa.Lending pool Unlike Borrower or Bailsman sub-accounts lending in Equilibrium is done in a pooled manner: Liquidity providers stake assets they want to lend into asset-specific pools and earn floating interest rates when borrowers and traders borrow assets. Equilibrium protocol does not guarantee liquidity, instead it relies on the interest rate model to incentivise it.

Equilibrium uses a methodology similar to the SEC’s Theoretical Intermarket Margining System (TIMS). The idea is that margin should be set to the maximum loss the portfolio would incur under adverse market scenarios.

Calculate collateral/bailsman/debt pool risk (portfolio volatility). Calculate discounts (Value at Risk) for each pool given confidence value and pool volatility. Calculate the value of the collateral/bailsman/debt pool in stressed market conditions.

Liquidity is a crucial part of any exchange that attracts active traders. Though, its depth and tiny spreads provided by market makers to an order book require quite a bit of inventory. We are solving this chicken or egg problem by incentivising liquidity providers who got used to having DeFi-like incomes to put their funds into dedicated  market maker pools. How will liquidity providers benefit? Similarly to regular DeFi protocols, liquidity providers don’t need to take any actions and will receive a passive income on their stakes in Equilibrium MM pools. Here is how this income will be generated: Our liquidity farming program offers staking rewards in our native tokens. Market makers will be sharing up to 50% of their trading profits with the pools eventually. Mechanics for market makers The flow for market makers will be as follows: Market makers will be subject to a revolving credit agreement with liquidity (margin) providers. Market maker accounts can borrow EQD and other stablecoins from MM pools. Market makers place orders to the order book and make markets in different assets with EQD as the quote currency. Market makers borrow base assets (e.g. BTC) directly from lending pools when their sell orders get filled. If withdrawals from the pool are higher in magnitude than what’s left un-borrowed from the pool, market makers are required to repay assets back to the pool at the end of the next epoch. Failure to return funds results in default and possible liability (debt in EQD stablecoins) on the MM account in the amount of the shortfall. Defaulted market makers are restricted from further borrowing from any of the pools until the liability is covered in full. We expect MM pool to become a robust instrument to facilitate user activity on our order book DEX. We are planning to run liquidity bootstrapping events to raise initial funding for the pool.

Referendum — A proposal for a change to the Equilibrium system including values for key parameters, code upgrades, or changes to the governance system itself.

Voting — Referenda will be voted on by EQ token holders on a stake-weighted basis. Referenda which pass are subject to delayed enactment such that people that disagree with the direction of the decision have time to exit the network.Governance Decentralisation Roadmap1.Initially, while developing, testing and finalising our core logic, Equilibrium will run on PoA consensus with a centralised sudo approach used for applying changes to the network.

2.After Equilibrium onboards as a parachain and delivers its line of products, we will introduce a governing council which will make Equilibrium-related decisions and changes to be visible on-chain. Changes to the protocol will still be managed via a SUDO. Council members will be elected from nominees on a basis, similar to what Polkadot does but with Equilibrium-specific parameters. 

3.At final stage, when system proves to be stable, we will enable recurring council elections, public and council proposed referenda, tallying, adaptive quorum biasing. We will publish the detailed list of system parameters the governance will be able to monitor and change.",Tokenomics,https://app.gitbook.com/share/space/thumbnail/-MK_3P6RnPHvv_Gsa_wJ/page/-MK_BhNhikVY5VuWn05O.png?color=%231792FF&logo=https%3A%2F%2F3730882694-files.gitbook.io%2F~%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252F-MK_3P6RnPHvv_Gsa_wJ%252Flogo%252FmIhcme1Z5TRtISM4wGBm%252FEQ.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D92da9bdb-93da-4d3c-92c7-9088efa5d6f7&theme=default,https://docs.equilibrium.io/governance/tokenomics,EQ Finance,docs,The first interest-bearing stablecoin backed by LSTs on Polkadot. ,"equilibrium, governance, tokenomics","DeFi, Stablecoin",Unknown Error,{}

dbc468a14b601d5d9240aeb72b9fcd2f8aed2f4e30932876edf8d16ec313846b,,"General FAQ1) What is the recommended wallet to use?All the wallets compatible with the Polkadot Ecosystem should work, however, we recommend using https://polkadot.js.org/ and SubWallet - Polkadot Extension Wallet. See here for download steps. 2) Does the Bit.County support multiple languages?We already implemented internalization in our code, however, it's in our roadmap to support multiple languages. We will offer bounties for the community who wants to offer assistance in translation.3) What is the use of NEER if we will use BIT?See here for more details. 4) Will there be ETH connection later on?Development of an Ethereum bridge is in development.5) What chains will NFT marketplace support, except DOT and KSM?At launch, only ours. Pioneer and Continuum. At some point, we will enable interoperability, and tokens that live on other chains will be tradeable on our marketplace. We simply want to make sure everything works properly before doing partnerships and opening the bi-directional XCM Channel to allow users to teleport assets from one chain to another.6) Why create a metaverse now without certainty of having lands to host it. What is the benefit? What is the added value? Why pay?Creating a Metaverse project not only allows you to build in it once you have land to deploy in it. Creating a Metaverse project will allow you to have your own Local NFT Marketplace, a way to collaborate and share information with your communities. Create DAO proposals and allow people to vote if they hold a specific token or NFT. You have Pulse, the Social/Community section that you can use to communicate with your community. Get royalties from every NFT being sold on your Metaverse project, regardless of you being the creator of the NFTs or if the creator just requested the NFTs to be sold in your Metaverse.7) Could we be sure that a metaverse created now could be exported to lands later? How many lands will be necessary?It's the opposite, Lands need to be deployed inside the Metaverse project. The 3D world can be built by deploying 1 Raw Land block, all the way up to 900 Land blocks.8) Why are we obliged to acquire NEER while we have already provided funds for NUUM? What will be our advantages as NUUM investors?We think of Bit.Country PioNEER as a more Community focused project. Whilst Continuum is more corporate-oriented. It will be more scalable, etc. You are not forced to buy $NEER if you don't want to build or create now. You can wait until $NUUM is released to put those tokens in staking or buying land to deploy on a Metaverse project minted on Continuum and use $NUUM for all the different utilities it was created for.9) Why is there a minimum of 100 $NEER in staking? We set a minimum of 100 $NEER as a protection measure to avoid spam transactions clogging the network &/or DDoS attacks. The value may be changed if a referendum passes via Governance proposal.10) What is the difference between Pioneer and Continuum? Bit.Country Pioneer is built on Kusama, the 'Canary Network' of Polkadot. The 'Canary Network' aims for projects to build with flexibility rapidly. Bit.Country Pioneer is built on Kusama. The next generation of Bit.Country Continuum will be built on the Polkadot blockchain.

At the beginning of each session we set this to a value that should fall  roughly in the middle of the session duration. The idea is to first wait for  the validators to produce a block in the current session, so that the  heartbeat later on will not be necessary.   This value will only be used as a fallback if we fail to get a proper session  progress estimate from NextSessionRotation, as those estimates should be  more accurate then the value we calculate for HeartbeatAfter.API Endpoint: api.query.imOnline.heartbeatAfterReturn Type: (Primitive: U32)KeysDescription:  The current set of keys that may issue a heartbeat.API Endpoint: api.query.imOnline.keysReturn Type: (Array[32]: Primitive U8)PalletVersionDescription: Returns the current pallet version from storageAPI Endpoint: api.query.imOnline.palletVersionReturn Type: (Primitive: U16)ReceivedHeartbeatsDescription:  For each session index, we keep a mapping of SessionIndex and AuthIndex.API Endpoint: api.query.imOnline.receivedHeartbeatsReturn Type: (Tuple: [ (Primitive: U32) , (Primitive: U32) ])+ Indices+ ConstantsDepositDescription:  The deposit needed for reserving an index.API Endpoint: api.consts.indices.depositChain Value: 100000000000Chain Value Type: (Primitive: U128)+ ErrorsInUseDescription: The index was not available.API Endpoint: api.errors.indices.inUseNotAssignedDescription: The index was not already assigned.API Endpoint: api.errors.indices.notAssignedNotOwnerDescription: The index is assigned to another account.API Endpoint: api.errors.indices.notOwnerNotTransferDescription: The source and destination accounts are identical.API Endpoint: api.errors.indices.notTransferPermanentDescription: The index is permanent and may not be freed/changed.API Endpoint: api.errors.indices.permanent+ EventsIndexAssignedDescription: A account index was assigned.API Endpoint: api.events.indices.indexAssignedFields: (T::AccountId: AccountId32, T::AccountIndex: u32)IndexFreedDescription: A account index has been freed up (unassigned).API Endpoint: api.events.indices.indexFreedFields: (T::AccountIndex: u32)IndexFrozenDescription: A account index has been frozen to its current account ID.API Endpoint: api.events.indices.indexFrozenFields: (T::AccountIndex: u32, T::AccountId: AccountId32)+ ExtrinsicsClaimDescription: See [Pallet::claim].API Endpoint: api.tx.indices.claimParameters: (index: u32)ForceTransferDescription: See [Pallet::force_transfer].API Endpoint: api.tx.indices.forceTransferParameters: (new: MultiAddress, index: u32, freeze: bool)FreeDescription: See [Pallet::free].API Endpoint: api.tx.indices.freeParameters: (index: u32)FreezeDescription: See [Pallet::freeze].API Endpoint: api.tx.indices.freezeParameters: (index: u32)TransferDescription: See [Pallet::transfer].API Endpoint: api.tx.indices.transferParameters: (new: MultiAddress, index: u32)+ StorageAccountsDescription:  The lookup from index to account.API Endpoint: api.query.indices.accountsReturn Type: (Primitive: U32)PalletVersionDescription: Returns the current pallet version from storageAPI Endpoint: api.query.indices.palletVersionReturn Type: (Primitive: U16)+ Initializer+ ConstantsNone+ ErrorsNone+ EventsNone+ ExtrinsicsForceApproveDescription: See [Pallet::force_approve].API Endpoint: api.tx.initializer.forceApproveParameters: (upTo: u32)+ StorageBufferedSessionChangesDescription:  Buffered session changes along with the block number at which they should be applied.

Semantically a bool, but this guarantees it should never hit the trie,  as this is cleared in on_finalize and Frame optimizes None values to be empty values.   As a bool, set(false) and remove() both lead to the next get() being false, but one  of them writes to the trie and one does not.

Note that the keys of this storage map might become non-decodable in case the  account's [NominationsQuota::MaxNominations] configuration is decreased.  In this rare case, these nominators  are still existent in storage, their key is correct and retrievable (i.e. contains_key  indicates that they exist), but their value cannot be decoded. Therefore, the non-decodable  nominators will effectively not-exist, until they re-submit their preferences such that it  is within the bounds of the newly set Config::MaxNominations.   This implies that ::iter_keys().count() and ::iter().count() might return different  values for this map. Moreover, the main ::count() is aligned with the former, namely the  number of keys that exist.   Lastly, if any of the nominators become non-decodable, they can be chilled immediately via  [Call::chill_other] dispatchable by anyone.

This value should be a superset of disabled validators since not all offences lead to the  validator being disabled (if there was no slash). This is needed to track the percentage of  validators that have offended in the current era, ensuring a new era is forced if  OffendingValidatorsThreshold is reached. The vec is always kept sorted so that we can find  whether a given validator has previously offended using binary search.

Ids are separated into unsorted bags according to their score. This specifies the  thresholds separating the bags. An id's bag is the largest bag for which the id's score  is less than or equal to its upper threshold.   When ids are iterated, higher bags are iterated completely before lower bags. This means  that iteration is _semi-sorted_: ids of higher score tend to come before ids of lower  score, but peer ids within a particular bag are sorted in insertion order.   # Expressing the constant   This constant must be sorted in strictly increasing order. Duplicate items are not  permitted.   There is an implied upper limit of Score::MAX; that value does not need to be  specified within the bag. For any two threshold lists, if one ends with  Score::MAX, the other one does not, and they are otherwise equal, the two  lists will behave identically.   # Calculation   It is recommended to generate the set of thresholds in a geometric series, such that  there exists some constant ratio such that threshold[k + 1] == (threshold[k] *  constant_ratio).max(threshold[k] + 1) for all k.   The helpers in the /utils/frame/generate-bags module can simplify this calculation.   # Examples   - If BagThresholds::get().is_empty(), then all ids are put into the same bag, and    iteration is strictly in insertion order.  - If BagThresholds::get().len() == 64, and the thresholds are determined according to    the procedure given above, then the constant ratio is equal to 2.  - If BagThresholds::get().len() == 200, and the thresholds are determined according to    the procedure given above, then the constant ratio is approximately equal to 1.248.  - If the threshold list begins [1, 2, 3, ...], then an id with score 0 or 1 will fall    into bag 0, an id with score 2 will fall into bag 1, etc.   # Migration   In the event that this list ever changes, a copy of the old bags list must be retained.  With that List::migrate can be called, which will perform the appropriate migration.API Endpoint: api.consts.voterList.bagThresholdsChain Value: [10000000000,11131723507,12391526824,13793905044,15354993703,17092754435,19027181634,21180532507,23577583160,26245913670,29216225417,32522694326,36203364094,40300583912,44861495728,49938576656,55590242767,61881521217,68884798439,76680653006,85358782760,95019036859,105772564622,117743094401,131068357174,145901671259,162413706368,180794447305,201255379901,224031924337,249386143848,277609759981,309027509097,344000878735,382932266827,426269611626,474511545609,528213132664,587992254562,654536720209,728612179460,811070932564,902861736593,1005040721687,1118783542717,1245398906179,1386343627960,1543239395225,1717891425287,1912309236147,2128729767682,2369643119512,2637821201686,2936349627828,3268663217709,3638585517729,4050372794022,4508763004364,5019030312352,5587045771074,6219344874498,6923202753807,7706717883882,8578905263043,9549800138161,10630573468586,11833660457397,13172903628838,14663712098160,16323238866411,18170578180087,20226985226447,22516120692255,25064322999817,27900911352605,31058523077268,34573489143434,38486252181966,42841831811331,47690342626046,53087570807094,59095615988698,65783605766662,73228491069308,81515931542404,90741281135191,101010685227495,112442301921293,125167661548718,139333180038781,155101843555358,172655083789626,192194865483744,213946010204502,238158783103893,265111772429462,295115094915607,328513963936552,365692661475578,407078959611349,453149042394237,504432984742966,561520851400862,625069486125324,695810069225823,774556530406243,862214913708369,959793802308039,1068415923109985,1189331064661951,1323930457019515,1473762779014021,1640551977100649,1826217100807404,2032894383008501,2262961819074188,2519066527700738,2804155208229882,3121508044894685,3474776448088622,3868025066902796,4305778556320752,""0x001107466b868e49"",""0x0012f49fde53c1b2"",""0x001519ceb22f8a27"",""0x00177d24849f39b2"",""0x001a25aa04e799e1"",""0x001d1b33abf513ba"",""0x00206678cc854726"",""0x0024112d3f80bf88"",""0x0028261df823981c"",""0x002cb150d422c4cc"",""0x0031c028058288f0"",""0x003761897e6d7c36"",""0x003da60ad329936e"",""0x0044a022136cbc8c"",""0x004c645c2af37000"",""0x0055099969843bb4"",""0x005ea950e4abb480"",""0x00695fdb79a9cda0"",""0x00754cc74c7fc24c"",""0x00829334ba0eacd0"",""0x00915a3dcf0c3e48"",""0x00a1cd69748ec668"",""0x00b41d2ba56f1e28"",""0x00c87f742623a998"",""0x00df304d63749af0"",""0x00f8728d4bfccd80"",""0x0114909a2d601490"",""0x0133dd45d913b4f0"",""0x0156b4c196359720"",""0x017d7dadaefbdc50"",""0x01a8aa47b99811e0"",""0x01d8b9bb16eec730"",""0x020e399786486e20"",""0x0249c7721d4bfaa0"",""0x028c12b5707111c0"",""0x02d5dea643168a80"",""0x032804a2b123f8c0"",""0x038376a27059af80"",""0x03e941ff872d6fc0"",""0x045a928fac7f9340"",""0x04d8b61771099100"",""0x056520215bdf0f40"",""0x06016e4449c14900"",""0x06af6ce5a6bc8e00"",""0x07711c8586565900"",""0x0848b7a434aa6880"",""0x0938b9529ee2a180"",""0x0a43e480e8abbd00"",""0x0b6d4c20b4722a00"",""0x0cb85c3313c0f180"",""0x0e28e3dccb3ca000"",""0x0fc3209e9a62b880"",""0x118bcad29356de00"",""0x138823934c7f5d00"",""0x15be0435df871a00"",""0x1833ef844bcea700"",""0x1af124eafb100100"",""0x1dfdb5d1e52a8000"",""0x21629d6034a12200"",""0x2529daf06b214400"",""0x295e8f82f1610200"",""0x2e0d1e85cf206600"",""0x3343525219108400"",""0x391084ca8fc1a000"",""0x3f85cc9314ad2600"",""0x46b62f6624cdd000"",""0x4eb6da1c9ae19c00"",""0x579f5f0cc2cc5800"",""0x6189fb78750a2000"",""0x6c93e4d6bbbb3000"",""0x78dd9edca7cb6000"",""0x868b5b42c03bb800"",""0x95c564612386b800"",""0xa6b893dc5ff1f800"",""0xb996d6c0916a2000"",""0xce97c08fe2efd800"",""0xe5f92ef59b296800"",""0xffffffffffffffff""]Chain Value Type: (Sequence: [object Object])+ ErrorsListDescription: A error in the list interface implementation.API Endpoint: api.errors.voterList.list+ EventsRebaggedDescription: Moved an account from one bag to another.API Endpoint: api.events.voterList.rebaggedFields: (T::AccountId: AccountId32, T::Score: u64, T::Score: u64)ScoreUpdatedDescription: Updated the score of some account to the given amount.API Endpoint: api.events.voterList.scoreUpdatedFields: (T::AccountId: AccountId32, T::Score: u64)+ ExtrinsicsPutInFrontOfDescription: See [Pallet::put_in_front_of].API Endpoint: api.tx.voterList.putInFrontOfParameters: (lighter: MultiAddress)PutInFrontOfOtherDescription: See [Pallet::put_in_front_of_other].API Endpoint: api.tx.voterList.putInFrontOfOtherParameters: (heavier: MultiAddress, lighter: MultiAddress)RebagDescription: See [Pallet::rebag].API Endpoint: api.tx.voterList.rebagParameters: (dislocated: MultiAddress)+ StorageCounterForListNodesDescription: Counter for the related counted storage mapAPI Endpoint: api.query.voterList.counterForListNodesReturn Type: (Primitive: U32)ListBagsDescription:  A bag stored in storage.

than using funds in a single account, smaller accounts with unique roles can complete tasks on
behalf of the main stash account. Proxies can be hotter than the initial account, which can be
kept cold, but the weight of the tokens in the colder account can be used by the hotter accounts.
This increases the security of your accounts by minimizing the number of transactions the cold
account has to make. This also drives attention away from the stash account, although it is possible
to determine the relationship between the proxy and the proxied account.From the security perspective, we can imagine proxies as bodyguards of a VIP, loyal and ready to
risk their lives to ensure the VIP's protection. But proxies are also useful in other contexts such
as efficient account management at the corporate level. They also provide an elegant solution to
change signatories within multi-signature accounts, and they can be used within proxy calls and
nested proxy calls. In this page we will explore all these interesting use cases of proxies within
the Polkadot ecosystem.Shown below is an example of how you might use these accounts. Imagine you have one stash account as
your primary token-holding account and don't want to access it very often, but you want to
participate in staking to earn staking rewards. You could set one of your existing accounts as a
staking proxy for that stash account, and use your staking proxy to sign all staking-related
transactions.Having a staking proxy will make the stash account isolated within the staking context. In other
words, the account assigned as a staking proxy can participate in staking on behalf of that stash.
Without the proxy you will need to sign all the staking-related transactions with the stash. If the
proxy is compromised, it doesn't have access to transfer-related transactions, so the stash account
could just set a new proxy to replace it. You can also monitor proxies by
setting a time-delay.Creating multiple proxy accounts that act for a single account, lets you come up with more granular
security practices around how you protect private keys while still being able to actively
participate in the network.infoThe maximum number of proxies allowed for a single account is
32.
 You
can have the same proxy for multiple accounts.Proxy Types​When a proxy account makes a transaction,
Polkadot filters the desired transaction to
ensure that the proxy account has the appropriate permission to make that transaction on behalf of
the proxied account. For example, staking proxies have permission to do only staking-related
transactions.When you set a proxy, you must choose a type of proxy for the relationship.
Polkadot offers:Any: allow any transaction, including balance transfers. In most cases, this should be avoided
as the proxy account is used more frequently than the cold account and is therefore less secure.Non-transfer: allow any type of transaction except
balance transfers (including vested
transfers). Hence, this proxy does not have permission to access calls in the Balances and XCM
pallet.Governance: allow to make transactions related to governance.Nomination pool: allow transactions pertaining to
Nomination Pools.Staking: allow all staking-related transactions. The stash account is meant to stay in cold
storage, while the staking proxy account makes day-to-day transactions like setting session keys
or deciding which validators to nominate. Visit the
Advanced Staking Concepts page for more detailed
information about staking proxies.Identity Judgement: allow registrars to make judgments on an account's identity. If you are
unfamiliar with judgment and identities on chain, please refer to
this page. This proxy can only access provide_judgement call
from the Identity pallet along with the calls from the Utility pallet.Cancel: allow to reject and remove any time-delay proxy announcements. This proxy can only
access reject_announcement call from the Proxy pallet.Auction: allow transactions pertaining to parachain auctions and crowdloans. The Auction proxy
account can sign those transactions on behalf of an account in cold storage. If you already set up
a Non-transfer proxy account, it can do everything an Auction proxy can do. Before participating
in a crowdloan using an Auction proxy, it is recommended that you check with the respective
parachain team for any possible issues pertaining to the crowdloan rewards distribution. Auction
proxy can access Auctions, Crowdloan, Registrar and Slots pallets.Proxy Deposits​Proxies require deposits in the native currency to be created. The deposit is required because
adding a proxy requires some storage space on-chain, which must be replicated across every peer in
the network. Due to the costly nature of this, these functions could open up the network to a
Denial-of-Service attack. To defend against this attack, proxies require a deposit to be reserved
while the storage space is consumed over the lifetime of the proxy. When the proxy is removed, so is
the storage space, and therefore the deposit is returned.The required deposit amount for n proxies is equal to:ProxyDepositBase + ProxyDepositFactor * nwhere the ProxyDepositBase is the required amount to be reserved for an account to have a proxy
list (creates one new item in storage). For every proxy the account has, an additional amount
defined by the ProxyDepositFactor is reserved as well (appends 33 bytes to storage location). The
ProxyDepositBase is
20.008 DOT

and the ProxyDepositFactor is
0.033 DOT.
Time-delayed Proxy​We can add a layer of security to proxies by giving them a delay time. The delay will be quantified
in blocks. Polkadot has approximately 6
seconds of block time. A delay value of 10 will mean ten blocks, which equals about one minute
delay.The proxy will announce its intended action and will wait for the number of blocks defined in the
delay time before executing it. Within this time window, the intended action may be canceled by
accounts that control the proxy.Announcing n calls using a time-delayed proxy also requires a deposit of the form:announcementDepositBase + announcementDepositFactor * nwhere the announcementDepositBase is the required amount to be reserved for an account to announce
a proxy call. For every proxy call the account has, an additional amount defined by the
announcementDepositFactor is reserved as well. The announcementDepositBase is
20.008 DOT

and the announcementDepositFactor is
0.066 DOT.

DOT tokens together on-chain to nominate
validators and receive rewards, significantly improving the system’s scalability. Now, anyone with
as little as
1 DOT can receive rewards for staking natively on Polkadot.
Note that rewards are not guaranteed for those pools that do not have enough bonded funds to be
included within the bags list. Only members of active
pools will receive rewards.There are currently
21309
members. (There can be a maximum of
49152
members.)There are currently
80
pools. (There can be a maximum of
64
pools)No limit on

members per pool.noteLearn the key differences between
Staking directly vs Joining a Nomination Pool.For Ledger users: Joining a nomination pool is possible only with the XL version of the Polkadot
Ledger App. This should be installed by default on Ledger Nano X and S Plus, but not on the Nano S.If you become a nomination pool member or a pool admin, you cannot participate in Governance with
the bonded tokens in the pool, as they are held in a
system account.Have questions on Nomination Pools?Please join the Polkadot Discord for asking general questions about
Nomination Pools. If you are a developer, please join our
nomination pools support channel.Nomination pools are one of the key features from the roadmap of staking improvements on
Polkadot. They are designed to
permissionlessly allow members to pool their funds together and act as a single nominator account.Due to the current runtime constraints,
Polkadot can only handle
22500

nominators comfortably in the electing set. As one of
the objectives of the NPoS algorithm is to maximize the overall stake on the
network, it can be inferred that the staking system on
Polkadot favors nominators with a larger
stake. Only the nominator accounts which back the validators in the active set are eligible for
receiving staking rewards. This leaves out nomination intents from the accounts with lower token
balance than the min-active nomination and places them in a waiting queue to enter electing set.
Nomination pools will be handy for members who want to participate in the staking system with a
stake much lower than the dynamic min-active nomination threshold on the network. All operations are
constant space and time complexity relative to the number of members, eliminating any theoretical
upper bound on the number of members the system can handle and thus scaling the number of accounts
that can participate and earn rewards in the staking system on
Polkadot. In summary, each nomination pool is
viewed as a single nominator from the NPoS system point of view.Why aren't the members in the nomination pools called delegators?The term delegator is associated too much with Delegated Proof of Staking (DPoS), and since
Polkadot implements Nominated Proof of Staking
(NPoS), naming them delegators would be misleading. The term member is our generic replacement for
delegator. In action, members are quite similar to delegators and delegate their nomination power
to the pool.The pool’s earnings are split pro rata to a member's stake in the bonded pool (and thus, the staking
rewards for members will be the same as if they were a nominator). Importantly, slashes are also
applied proportionally to members who may have been actively bonded.Key Components​Bonded Pool: Tracks the distribution of actively staked funds.Reward Pool: Tracks rewards earned by actively staked funds.Unbonding Sub Pools: Collection of pools at different phases (i.e. eras) of the unbonding
lifecycle.Members: Accounts that nominate to the pools.Point: Unit of measure for a member’s portion of a pool's funds. All pools start with a point to
Planck ratio of 1. Over time, if the pool receives rewards, they increase in value, and if the
pool is slashed, it decreases in value.Pool Member Lifecycle​Join a pool​A member delegates funds to a pool by transferring some amount to the pool’s bonded account with the
join extrinsic. The pool then increases its bond with the new funds. A member is afforded the
ability to bond additional funds or re-stake rewards as long as they are already actively bonded.
Note that a member may only belong to one pool at a time.The current minimum bond to join a pool on
Polkadot
is 1 DOT.
infoThe funds nominated to a pool will not be visible in the member's account balance on Polkadot JS
Apps UI. This is because the member funds are transferred from their account to the pool's
system account. This pool account is not accessible
by anyone (including the pool root or depositor) and only the pool's internal logic can access the
account.Use Non-Transfer or Nomination Pools Proxy Accounts to join Nomination PoolsOnly non-transfer proxies and
nomination pools proxy can be used to participate in
nomination pools. Staking proxies cannot be used as they cannot
make calls to the nomination pools pallet. (The nomination pools will be supported through a staking
proxy when the changes made in this PR are
released on the network.Thus, depending on how much control you want to give your proxy, you might choose between
non-transfer > staking > nomination pool proxy, with the latter being only able to sign transactions
related to the NominationPool pallet.Check the ""How to join a pool"" section in
this support article
for guidelines.Claim rewards​The member can claim their portion of any rewards that have accumulated since the previous time they
claimed (or in the case that they have never claimed, any rewards that have accumulated since the
era after they joined). Rewards are split pro rata among the actively bonded members. Check the ""How
to claim rewards"" section in
this support article
for guidelines.Claim Permissions​As a pool member, you can grant permission to any other account to claim and compound rewards on
your behalf. There are four permission options:Permissioned (default): you need to claim and compound your rewards.PermissionlessCompound: you grant permission to any other account to compound (claim and bond)
your rewards on your behalf.PermissionlessWithdraw: you grant permission to any other account to withdraw (claim and keep as
a free balance) your rewards on your behalf.PermissionlessAll: you grant permission to any other account to compound or withdraw your
rewards on your behalf.See the Staking Dashboard page for more information about
how to set your claim permissions.See the advanced guides to
learn how to claim rewards for another pool member.Unbond and withdraw funds​At any point in time after joining the pool, a member can start the process of exiting by unbonding.
unbond will unbond part or all of the member's funds. After unbond has been called and the
unbonding duration has passed
(28

eras which correspond to
28

days on Polkadot),  a member may withdraw
their funds with withdrawUnbonded. Withdrawing effectively ends a member's relationship with their
pool, allowing them to join a different pool if desired. Check the ""Withdraw unbonded funds"" section
in
this support article
for guidelines.Unbonding transaction automatically triggers withdrawal of rewardsWhen there is a change in the bonded balance, the accumulated rewards in the pool thus far are
automatically withdrawn to the account. The rewards are then accrued based on the updated bonded
balance.Limitations of Nomination Pools​A member cannot vote (e.g. in Referenda or for Council members) with their nominated funds. This
may be changed in the future once accounts are afforded the ability to split votes.For a member to switch pools, all funds from the account must be unbonded. This process takes 28
eras.A member can partially unbond the staked funds in the pool (at most 16 partial unbonds).Pool Administration​States​Open: The pool is open to be joined by anyone.Blocked: The pool is blocked; no joiners are permitted.Destroying: The pool is in the process of being destroyed. Once in this state, the pool may never
revert to any other state; it can only proceed to be destroyed. All members can be
permissionlessly unbonded; this allows the pool to be dismantled regardless of any member’s
proactivity.Roles​Depositor: Creates the pool and is the initial member. The depositor can only leave the pool once
all other members have left. Once they leave by withdrawing, the pool is fully removed from the
system.Nominator: Can select the validators the pool nominates.Bouncer: Can change the pool’s state and kick (permissionlessly unbond/withdraw) members if the
pool is blocked.Root: Can change the nominator, bouncer, or itself. Further, it can perform any of the actions the
nominator or bouncer can.Pool Commissions​As the pool root role, you can set pool commissions that will be applied to the staking rewards paid
out to the pool's system account before rewards are allocated for the pool members. You can set pool
commissions through the Polkadot Staking Dashboard.Three methods can be used when setting the pool commission:Commission Rate (nominationPools.setCommission extrinsic): the start or new commission rate
(newCommission parameter) that can be set between 0% and
10%
(decided through governance referendum) via the
globalMaxCommission
parameter. You will need to specify an Input Payee Account, i.e. the account that will receive the
commission.Max Commission (nominationPools.setCommissionMax extrinsic): the maximum commission
(maxCommission parameter) the pool will apply to its members (between 0% and Max Commission).
Note that once set, the pool admin can only lower it.Change Rate (nominationPools.setCommissionChangeRate extrinsic): the maximum rate increase
(maxIncrease parameter) allowed for a single commission update. Note that once set, the pool
admin can only lower it. When setting the Change Rate, it will also be possible to set a
minDelay quantified as the number of blocks (since last commission update) after which it is
possible to change the commission (i.e. the minimum delay between commission updates). Note that
once set, the pool admin can only increase it.Max Commission and Change Rate must not be necessarily set. It is the choice of the pool admin to
set those parameters and provide transparency to the pool members about the pool's commission
policy.Max Commission and Change Rate are currently permanentOnce the Max Commission and the Change Rate are set, the pool admin currently can only decrease
those values. The minimum delay between commission updates can only be increased. The situation can
change in the future and a forceSetCommissionMax method can be proposed through governance
referendum.Let's take, for example, Pool A, which sets the Commission Rate to 10%, the Max Commission to 100%,
and the Change Rate to 1% every 300 blocks (which equates to approximately 30 minutes). The
following statements are true:The pool commission can be increased by 1% every 30 minutes. Bigger increases are not allowed.
Increases of less than or equal to 1% are not allowed sooner than 30 minutes since the last
commission update.The Max Commission can only be decreased from 100%. Once decreased, it can be decreased again but
it cannot be increased.The Change Rate's maximum increase can only be decreased from 1%. Once decreased, it can be
decreased again but it cannot be increased.The Change Rate's minimum delay between updates of 30 min can only be increased. Once increased,
it can be increased again but it cannot be decreased.Pool Lifecycle​Advanced How-to GuidesSee this page for more information about the lifecycle
of nomination pools. The cycle includes creation, upkeep and destruction.Nomination Pools - Slashing​Suppose the staking system slashes a pool’s underlying nomination account. In that case, the slash
is distributed evenly across the bonded pool, and the unbonding pools from slash era+1 through the
slash apply era. Thus, any member who either a) was unbonding or b) was actively bonded in the
aforementioned range of eras will be affected by the slash. In other words, a member who may have
been actively bonded during the offence is slashed pro rata based on its stake relative to the total
slash amount.Unbonding pools need to be slashed to ensure all nominators who were in the bonded pool while it was
backing a validator that committed an offense are punished. Without these measures a nominator could
unbond right after a validator equivocated with no consequences.This strategy is unfair to members who joined after the slash because they get slashed as well, but
it spares members who unbond. The latter is much more important for security: if a pool's validators
attack the network, their members need to unbond fast! Avoiding additional slashes gives them an
incentive to do that if validators get repeatedly slashed.Nominating vs Joining a Pool​Nominating is the action of choosing validators. It does not simply involve bonding tokens.
Nominating is an active task, which implies that you regularly monitor that your stake is backing an
active validator in all the eras and check if you are receiving your staking rewards. More
importantly, ensure that the validators you chose always act in the best interests of the network
protocol and have less chance of getting slashed. To nominate, you need a minimum of
10 DOT,
and to receive rewards, you need at least a balance greater than the minimum active bond. Depending
on your validators, if your active validator is oversubscribed, you will earn rewards only if your
stake is within that of the top
512
nominators. If the validator misbehaves, It is worth noting that your stake is subject to slashing,
irrespective of whether you are at the top
512
nominators or not.As the minimum active bond is a dynamic value, it can make your nomination inactive when the
threshold goes above your bonded balance. Hence, to be eligible to earn rewards while nominating,
you would need to stake a much higher balance than the minimum active bond.Nomination pools are a way to participate in staking with as little as 1 DOT and earn staking
rewards. Nomination pools differ from custodial solutions (like staking through central exchanges)
because they are non-custodial, native to Polkadot's protocol, permissionless, transparent, and run
in a decentralized way by the community. Before joining a nomination pool, you must ensure that the
pool is earning rewards and nominating the validators that match your preferences. Participating in
pools is more of a set-and-forget action than nominating by yourself. The pool operator maintains
the list of validators nominated by the pool, and so, in a way, you are trusting the pool operator
to act in your best interests. However, it is advised to check the validators nominated by the pool
from time to time and change the pool if necessary.Minimum Active Nomination Value is DynamicThe minimum amount required to become an active nominator and earn rewards is
293.700 DOT.

If you have less DOT than the minimum active
nomination and still want to participate in staking, you can join the nomination pools. You can now
stake on Polkadot natively with just
1 DOT

in the nomination pools and earn staking rewards. For additional information, see
this blog post.

agreed upon by stake-weighted referenda.Premise​Polkadot's first governance system
(Governance V1) included three main components.The Technical Committee: A technocratic committee to
manage upgrade timelines.The Council: An approval-voted, elected executive ""government"" to
manage parameters, admin, and spending proposals.The Public: All token holders.Over the first few years of operation, Governance V1 ensured the appropriate usage of treasury funds
and enabled timely upgrades and fixes. Like most early technologies, protocols must evolve as they
mature to improve their shortcomings and keep up with modern advancements. In Governance V1, all
referenda carried the same weight as only one referendum could be voted on at a time (except for
emergency proposals), and the voting period could last multiple weeks. Also, an
alternating voting timetable allowed to vote
either for a public referendum or a council motion every
28 days. This resulted in the system favoring
careful consideration of very few proposals instead of broad consideration of many.Polkadot OpenGov changes how the practical means of day-to-day decisions are made, making the
repercussions of referenda better scoped and agile to increase the number of collective decisions
the system can make at any given time.The following content is focused on what the new Polkadot OpenGov version brings to the governance
on Polkadot, and on the main differences with
previous governance versions. We recommend learning about Governance v1 to
better understand the need for and the direction of Polkadot OpenGov.Summary​In Governance v1, active token holders (public) and the Council together administrated network's
upgrade decisions. Whether the public or the council initiated the proposal, it would eventually
have to go through a referendum to let all holders (weighted by stake and conviction) make the
decision.The Council fulfilled its role as the representative of the public, guardian of the treasury and
initiator of legislation, but it was often seen as a centralized entity. To further decentralize
Polkadot, Polkadot OpenGov proposes the
following main changes:Migrating all responsibilities of the Council to the public via a direct democracy voting system.Dissolving the current Council collectiveAllowing users to delegate voting power in more ways to community membersDissolving the Technical Committee and establishing
the broader Polkadot Technical FellowshipThe figure below shows an overview of Polkadot OpenGov's structure.infoSee this page for a comparison with the structure of Governance V1.In Polkadot OpenGov, all the proposals are initiated by the public. The proposal will enter a
Lead-in period (for more information, see Referenda Timeline), after which it
will follow a specific Track which has a dedicated Origin. There are
15 Origins, each with a different
track. The origins and tracks parameters are preset values that set the duration of a referendum as
well as how many referenda can be voted on simultaneously. For example, a treasury proposal can now
be submitted in different tracks depending on the amount requested. A proposal for a small tip will
need to be submitted in the Small Tipper track, while a proposal requiring substantial funds will
need to be submitted to the Medium or Big Spender track.The Polkadot Technical Fellowship can decide to
whitelist a proposal that will be enacted through the Whitelist Caller origin.
Those proposals will have a shorter Lead-in, Confirmation, and Enactment period when compared to the
Root Origin track.Each track has its own preset Approval and Support curves which are based
on the origin's privileges. When both the approval and support criteria are satisfied for a specific
period (called the confirmation period), the referenda passes and will be executed after the
enactment period.All referenda within each track and across tracks can be voted on simultaneously (assuming track
maximum capacity is not reached).Polkadot OpenGov also comes with multi-role delegations where the token holder can assign voting
power on different tracks to different entities who are experts in judging the referenda submitted
to those tracks. For example, suppose a token holder does not have the technical background to
consider the merits and vote on the referenda submitted to the Root track. In that case, they can
delegate their voting power just for the Root track to a trusted expert who (according to them) acts
in the best interest of the network protocol. In this way, token holders do not need to be
up-to-date with governance matters and can still make their votes count through delegates.Delegation DashboardTo easily delegate your votes you can use the

Referenda in this origin must be carefully scrutinized. Therefore, there is only one track (i.e. only one referendum at a time can be executed).Referenda executed from multiple origins, each with a different track that shapes proposals’ timelines. Depending on the origin, multiple referenda within the same track are possible.Possibility to categorize proposals (based on importance and urgency) and execute them simultaneously within and between origin tracks.Proposals can be submitted by either the Council or the Public.The public submits proposals.More democratic.Uses Adaptive Quorum Biasing to define the approval threshold based on turnout. Given the same turnout, council-initiated referenda require fewer Aye votes to pass compared to public referenda.Uses origin-specific approval and support curves defining the amount of approval and support (i.e. turnout) needed as a function of time. The same curves are applied to all referenda within the same origin track.Referenda timeline depends on the origin and not on who submitted the proposal (i.e. Council or Public). This is a more democratic and equalitarian system.Uses alternating voting timetable allowing voters to cast votes for either council or public referenda every 28 eras.Multiple referenda can be voted at the same time.More flexible and agile governance system.Except for emergency proposals, all referenda have fixed voting and enactment periods of 28 eras.Periods' length is customizable and has pre-defined limits for each origin. The same limits apply to all tracks with the same origin. For example, the track in the origin Root will be longer than the track within the Small Tipper origin.Referenda’s timeline is tailored to their importance and urgency. Flexible enactment period based on origin.Emergency proposals turned referenda can be simultaneously voted on and executed with other referenda and have shorter enactment periods. They must be proposed by the Technical Committee and approved by the Council.No emergency proposals. The Technical Fellowship can whitelist proposals that will have their origin with shorter lead-in, confirmation, and enactment periods.The Technical Fellowship is a more decentralized entity when compared to the Technical Committee. Whitelisting a proposal requires a majority of approval from the fellowship.Only the most-endorsed proposal is able to transit from Launch to Voting period. The time for the transition is indeterminate, and (with no possibility of canceling endorsements) proposers and endorsers might wait a long time before a referendum is tabled, and getting their deposits back.All proposals will eventually be voted on (given track capacity and deposit are met and the Lead-in period has ended).It allows all proposals to get a chance to be voted on in a timely predictive manner.Only aye or nay votes possible.Voters can have the additional voting options of abstaining or splitting votes.More ways to engage in voting and increase turnout.Voters can decide to delegate votes to another account.Voters can use multirole delegations and delegate votes to different accounts depending on origins.More agile delegations tailored by expertise.Proposals​Starting a proposal in Governance v1See this page for more information about starting referenda in

and ultimately enacted. Instead, the proposal will stay within a Lead-in Period until it
fulfills three criteria:Proposals must stay within the lead-in period for a pre-defined minimum amount of time. This helps
mitigate against the possibility of ""decision sniping"" where an attacker controlling a substantial
amount of voting power might seek to have a proposal passed immediately after proposing, not
allowing the overall voting population adequate time to consider and participate.There must be enough room for the decision within the origin. Different origins have their limit
on the number of proposals that can be decided simultaneously. Tracks that have more potent
abilities will have lower limits. For example, the Root level Origin has a limit of one, implying
that only a single proposal may be decided on at once.A decision deposit must be submitted. Creating a referendum is cheap as the deposit value consists
of only the value required for the on-chain storage needed to track it. But, having a referendum
reviewed and decided upon carries the risk of using up the limited spots available in the
referenda queue. Having a more significant but refundable deposit requirement makes sense to help
mitigate spam. Failing to submit the decision deposit will lead to a referendum timeout.Until they are in the lead-in period, proposals remain undecided. Once the criteria above are met,
the referendum moves to the deciding state. The votes of the referendum are now counted towards
the outcome.In (2), the proposal enters the Decision Period where votes can be cast. For a proposal to be
approved, votes must satisfy the approval and support criteria for at least the Confirmation
Period; otherwise, the proposal is automatically rejected. A rejected proposal can be resubmitted
anytime and as many times as needed.In (3), approved proposals will enter the Enactment Period, after which proposed changes will be
executed.Note how the length of the lead-in, decision, confirmation, and enactment periods vary depending on
the origin. Root origin has more extended periods than the other origins. Also, the number of
referenda within each track differs, with the Root origin track only accepting one. proposal at a
time (see below).This directly affects the number of proposals that can be voted on and executed simultaneously.
Continuing the comparison between Root and Small Tipper, Small Tipper will allow many proposals on
its track to be executed simultaneously. In contrast, Root will allow only one proposal in its
track. Once the track capacity is filled, additional proposals in the lead-in period will queue
until place is available to enter the decision period.Origins and Tracks​An Origin is a specific level of privilege that will determine the Track of all referenda
executed with that origin. The track is basically a pipeline in which the proposal lives and
proceeds and is independent from other origins' tracks. The proposer of the referenda now selects an
appropriate Origin for their request based on the proposal’s requirements.Although the track structure is the same for all origins, track parameters are not. Such parameters
include:Maximum Deciding or Capacity: the limit for the number of referenda that can be decided at
once (i.e. the number of tracks within each origin).Decision deposit: the amount of funds that must be placed on deposit to enter the Decision
Period (note that more requirements must be met to enter the Decision Period).Preparation Period: the minimum amount of voting time needed before entering the Decision
Period (given capacity and deposit are met).Decision Period: the maximum time to approve a proposal. The proposal will be accepted if
approved by the end of the period.Confirmation Period: the minimum amount of time (within the Decision Period) the approval and
support criteria must hold before the proposal is approved and moved to the enactment period.Minimum Enactment Period: the minimum amount of waiting time before the proposed changes are
appliedApproval Curve: the curve describing the minimum % of aye votes as a function of time within
the Decision Period. The approval % is the portion of aye votes (adjusted for conviction) over
the total votes (aye, nay, and abstained).Support Curve: the curve describing the minimum % of all votes in support of a proposal as a
function of time within the Decision Period. The support % is defined as the portion of all votes
(aye and abstained) without conviction over the total possible amount of votes in the system
(i.e. the total active issuance).For example, a runtime upgrade (requiring a set_code call, if approved) does not have the same
implications for the ecosystem as the approval of a treasury tip (reportAwesome call), and
therefore different Origins for these two actions are needed in which different deposits, support,
approval, and a minimum enactment periods will be predetermined on the pallet.For detailed information about origin and tracks, and parameter values in Kusama, see
this page.Approval and Support​Adaptive Quorum Biasing is deprecatedIn Polkadot OpenGov, Adaptive quorum biasing used
in Governance V1 has been replaced with the Approval and Support system.The figure above provides a summary view of how the approval and support system works during the
Decision Period.Once the proposal exits the Lead-in Period and enters the Voting Period, to be approved, it must
satisfy the approval and support criteria for the Confirmation Period.Approval is defined as the share of approval (aye votes) vote-weight (after adjustment for
conviction) against the total vote-weight (aye, nay, and abstained).Support is the total number of aye and abstain votes (ignoring any adjustment for
conviction) compared to the total possible votes that could be made in the system. In case of
split votes, only aye and abstain will count.Nay votes are not counted towards SupportSupport is a measure of voters who turned out either in favor of the referenda and who consciously
abstained from it. Support does not include nay votes. This avoids edge situations where nay
votes could push a referendum into confirming state. For example, imagine current approval is high
(near 100%, way above the approval curve), and current support is just below the support curve. A
nay could bump support above the support curve but not reduce approval below the approval curve.
Therefore someone voting against a proposal would make it pass. Hence, a decrease in % of current
approval through new votes does not directly translate into increasing support because Support needs
to consider nay votes.The figure above shows the followings:Even if the approval threshold is reached (i.e. % of current approval is greater than the approval
curve), the proposal only enters the confirmation period once the support threshold is also
reached (i.e. % current support is greater than the underlying support curve).If the referendum meets the criteria for the confirmation period, then the proposal is approved
and scheduled for enactment. The Enactment Period can be specified when the referendum is proposed
but is also subject to a minimum value based on the Track. More powerful Tracks enforce a larger
Enactment Period to ensure the network has ample time to prepare for any changes the proposal may
bring.A referendum may exit the confirmation period when the thresholds are no longer met, due to new
Nay votes or a change of existing Aye or Abstain votes to Nay . Each time it exits, the
confirmation period resets. For example, if the confirmation period is 20 minutes and a referendum
enters it just for 5 min, the next time it enters, it must stay for 20 minutes (not 15 minutes).During the decision period, if a referendum fails to meet the approval and support thresholds for
the duration of the track-specific confirmation period, it fails and does not go to the enactment
period (it may have to be resubmitted, see below).The current approval must be above 50% for a referendum to pass, and the approval curve never goes
below 50%.Note that support may not increase monotonically as shown in the figure, as people might switch
votes.Different Origins' tracks have different Confirmation Periods and requirements for approval and
support. For additional details on the various origins and tracks, check out
this table. Configuring the amount of
support and overall approval required for it to pass is now possible. With proposals that use less
privileged origins, it is far more reasonable to drop the required support to a more realistic
amount earlier than those which use highly privileged classes such as Root. Classes with more
significance can be made to require higher approval early on, to avoid controversy.Enactment​Enactment in Governance v1See this page for more information about enactment in Governance
v1.In Polkadot OpenGov, the proposer suggests the enactment period, but there are also minimums set for
each Origin Track. For example, root Origin approvals require a more extended period because of the
importance of the changes they bring to the network.Voting on a Referendum​In Governance V1, voters could cast only an aye or nay vote. In Polkadot OpenGov, voters can
additionally cast a abstain and split votes.
Vote splitting allows voters to allocate
different votes for aye, nay, and abstain.Only the last vote countsVoting a second time replaces your original vote, e.g. voting with 10
DOT, then a second extrinsic to vote with 5
DOT, means that you are voting with 5
DOT, not 10
DOT.Note that to successfully cast votes you need to have the
existential deposit and some additional funds
to pay for transaction fees.Voluntary Locking​Polkadot utilizes an idea called voluntary
locking that allows token holders to increase their voting power by declaring how long they are
willing to lock up their tokens; hence, the number of votes for each token holder will be calculated
by the following formula:votes = tokens * conviction_multiplier
The conviction multiplier increases the vote multiplier by one every time the number of lock periods
double.Lock PeriodsVote MultiplierLength in Days00.10117221443288456165112326224The maximum number of ""doublings"" of the lock period is set to 6 (and thus 32 lock periods in
total), and one lock period equals
7

days. For additional information regarding the timeline of governance events, check out the
governance section on the
Polkadot Parameters page.do votes stack?You can use the same number of tokens to vote on different referenda. Votes with conviction do not
stack. If you voted with 5 DOT on Referenda A, B
and C with 2x conviction you would have 10 votes on all those referenda and 5
DOT locked up only for the 2x conviction period
(i.e. two weeks), with the unlocking
countdown starting when the last referendum you voted on ends (assuming you are on the winning
side). If you voted with conviction on referendum and then a week later voted on another one with
the same conviction, the lock on your DOT will be
extended by a week (always assuming you are on the winning side).Staked tokens can be used in governanceWhile a token is locked, you can still use it for voting and staking. You are
only prohibited from transferring these tokens to another account.Votes are always ""counted"" at the same time (at the end of the voting period), no matter for how
long the tokens are locked.See below an example that shows how voluntary locking works.Peter: Votes No with
10 DOT for a 32-week lock period
=> 10 x 6 = 60 VotesLogan: Votes Yes with
20 DOT for one week lock period =>
20 x 1 = 20 VotesKevin: Votes Yes with
15 DOT for a 2-week lock period
=> 15 x 2 = 30 VotesEven though combined both Logan and Kevin vote with more
DOT than Peter, the lock period for both of them
is less than Peter, leading to their voting power counting as less.Conviction Voting Locks created during Gov 1Conviction voting locks in Governance v1 will not be carried over to OpenGov. Voting with conviction
in OpenGov will create a new lock (as this will use the convictionVoting pallet), while any
existing lock under Governance v1 (using the deprecated democracy pallet) will be left to expire.
Delegations under Governance v1 will need to be re-issued under OpenGov.Multirole Delegation​Polkadot OpenGov builds on the
vote delegation feature from Governance v1 where a voter can
delegate their voting power to another voter. It does so by introducing a feature known as
multirole delegation, where voters can specify a different delegate for every class of
referendum in the system. Delegation can be done per track, and accounts can choose to select
different delegates (or no delegation) for each track.For example, a voter could delegate one entity for managing a less potent referenda class, choose a
different delegate for another class with more powerful consequences and still retain full voting
power over any remaining classes.Delegate your votesIn Polkadot OpenGov you can delegate your votes to different entities, who will vote on your behalf.
You can delegate your votes using the
Polkadot Delegation Dashboard. See
this video tutorial to learn about the features of
the dashboard.If you are staking directly and not through a nomination pool, you can use bonded tokens for voting.
Note that if you are voting with conviction, your tokens will have a democracy lock in addition to
the staking lock. For more information about locks, see
this page.Democracy locks created through conviction voting start the unlocking period
after a referendum ends, provided you voted with the winning side. In the case of delegations, the
unlocking period countdown begins after the account undelegates. There can be different scenarios:if the account delegated votes to one delegate, then after undelegating, there will be one
unlocking period with length dependent on the conviction multiplier.if the account delegated votes to different delegates using different convictions, then after
undelegating those delegates, there will be different unlocking periods with lengths dependent on
the conviction multipliers.It is worth noting that a user delegating their voting power does not imply that the delegate will
have control over the funds of the delegating user's account. That delegate's account can vote with
a user's voting power but won't be able to transfer balances, nominate a different set of
validators, or execute any call other than voting on the tracks defined by the user.The goal of delegations is to ensure the required support for proposals to be enacted is reached
while keeping the overall design censorship-free. Also, voters might not have the technical
knowledge to judge some referenda or might not have the time to read all referenda. Delegations
allow voters to participate in OpenGov hands-free by delegating their voting power to trusted
entities.For a step-by-step outline of how to delegate voting power in Polkadot OpenGov, check out the
Delegating Voting Power section on the
Polkadot OpenGov Guides.The Polkadot Technical Fellowship​From Technical Committee to the Technical FellowshipThe Polkadot Technical Fellowship is a collection of Substrate experts. This fellowship was
established in 2022. In Polkadot OpenGov, this fellowship replaces the
Technical Committee in Governance v1, and will serve
both the Polkadot and Kusama networks.For more information about the Fellowship see the
Fellowship Manifesto.The Technical Fellowship is a mostly self-governing expert body with a primary goal of representing
humans who embody and contain the technical knowledge base of the Kusama and/or Polkadot networks
and protocols. This is accomplished by associating a rank with members to categorize the degree to
which the system expects their opinion to be well-informed, of a sound technical basis, and in line
with the interests of Polkadot and/or Kusama.Unlike the Technical Committee in Governance V1, the Fellowship is designed to be far broader in
membership (i.e. to work well with even tens of thousands of members) and with far lower barriers to
entry (both in terms of administrative process flow and expectations of expertise).The mechanism by which the Fellowship votes is the same as what is used for Polkadot and Kusama
stakeholder voting for a proposed referendum. Members of the Fellowship can vote on any given
Fellowship proposal and the aggregated opinion of the members (weighted by their rank) constitutes
the Fellowship's considered opinion.The Polkadot Technical Fellowship resides on the
Collectives
parachain and maintains the Polkadot Fellows repository. The
fellowship also has its own governance model with multiple tracks with approval and support
parameters, where the votes are weighted by the rank of the member.

The fellowship governance is primarily used for its membership management,
approving RFCs and whitelisting Polkadot OpenGov
proposals.Ranking System​To prevent a small group of participants from gaining effective control over the network, this
system will adhere to three main principles:The Fellowship must never have hard power over the network: it cannot change the parameters,
conduct rescues or move assets. Their only power in governance is reducing the effective timeline
on which a referendum takes place through whitelisting.The Fellowship weights those with a higher rank more in the aggregate opinion. However, the weight
should not be so high as to make a small number of higher members’ opinions be insurmountable
compared to a coherent opinion from lower-ranked membership.The Fellowship should be designed to grow and develop its membership, aggregate levels of
expertise and ensure that its overall decision-making capacity strengthens over time.To support these conditions, the Fellowship will have a constitution that outlines the requirements
and expectations for individuals to attain and retain any given rank. Higher ranks can vote and
promote lower ranks based on this constitution.Demotion occurs automatically after a given period has elapsed, and the member is unable to
defend their position to their peers.Suspension can happen only through a referendum, which ensures that the Fellowship's bias alone
does not necessarily result in expulsion.To prevent the Fellowship from becoming a cabal (popularity with Fellowship peers alone should not
be enough to gain access to a top rank), gaining access to the top tiers of the ranks will require a
referendum.Whitelisting​Polkadot OpenGov allows the Fellowship to authorize a new origin (known as ""Whitelisted-Caller"") to
execute with Root-level privileges for calls that have been approved by the Fellowship (currently
only level-three fellows and above can vote for whitelist calls).The Whitelist pallet allows one
Origin to escalate the privilege level of another Origin for a certain operation. The pallet
verifies two things:The origin of the escalation is the Whitelisted-Root (i.e. that the referendum passed on this
track), andThe whitelist contains the given proposal (in the configuration of Polkadot OpenGov, it gets there
via a separate Fellowship referendum).If both conditions are true, the operation executes with Root-level privileges.This system enables a new parallel Track (Whitelisted-Caller), whose parameters have less
restrictive passing parameters than Root in the short term. Through an open and transparent process,
a body of global experts on the Polkadot
protocol have determined that the action is both safe and time-critical.Submitting Whitelisted ProposalsFor more information about how to submit a whitelisted proposal see the
dedicated advanced how-to guides.Becoming a Polkadot Technical Fellowship Member​Currently, the only way to become a fellowship member is through a referenda. To get added as a
member of ""Rank 1"", an existing member of the fellowship needs to submit a referendum with the
preimage of a batch call that has fellowshipCollective.addMember and
fellowshipCollective.promoteMember on ""2/Proficients"" track. On Polkadot-JS UI for Polkadot
Collectives, navigate to Governance > Fellowship > Referenda and click on ""Add Preimage"". This
preimage can be submitted by anyone.After the preimage is successfully noted, navigate to Governance > Fellowship > Referenda and click
on ""Submit Proposal"" (This button is active on the UI only if you have an account that belongs to
the Fellowship). Choose the appropriate track and the origin, and enter the preimage hash of the
batch call that adds and promotes the member.After the referendum is successfully executed, the member is added to the fellowship with ""rank 1"".
For example, check the Referenda 23 on
the Collectives parachain. If a member has to be added and promoted to “rank 5”, the proposal has to
be submitted through track “6/Senior Experts” (Always a track with a rank higher). For example,
check the Referenda 25 on the
Collectives parachain.Future plans include that public members can apply to become a Fellowship candidate by placing a
small deposit (which will be returned once they become members). Their candidacy will go through a
referendum to be approved to become a member.Resources​Democracy PalletGovernance v2Polkadot DirectionKusama DirectionPolkAssemblyPolkadot-JS GuidesIf you are an advanced user, see the

mind that XCM is under active development.The Cross-Consensus Message Format, or XCM, is a messaging format and language used to
communicate between consensus systems.One of Polkadot's main functionalities is
interoperability amongst parachains and any other participating consensus-driven systems. XCM is the
language through which complex, cross-consensus interactions can occur. Two blockchains can ""speak""
XCM to seamlessly interact with each other using a standard messaging format.infoWe typically discuss XCM in the context of parachains, but please bear this in mind that it expands
to the domain of all consensus systems! Remember, a consensus system here means any system or
protocol that achieves finality to agree on the latest and correct state, whether it's a Polkadot
parachain, an EVM smart contract, or other bridged consensus systems.XCM is not meant to be only specific to
Polkadot, but rather its primary intention is
to define a generic and common format amongst different consensus systems to communicate.It's important to note that XCM does not define how messages are delivered but rather define how
they should look, act, and contain relative instructions to the on-chain actions the message intends
to perform.XCMP, or Cross Chain Message Passing, is the actual
network-layer protocol to deliver XCM-formatted messages to other participating parachains. There
are other ways to define transport layer protocols for delivering XCM messages(see:
HRMP and
VMP).XCM has four high-level core design principles which it stands to follow:Asynchronous: XCM messages in no way assume that the sender will be blocking on its
completion.Absolute: XCM messages are guaranteed to be delivered and interpreted accurately, in order
and in a timely fashion. Once a message is sent, one can be sure it will be processed as it was
intended to be.Asymmetric: XCM messages, by default, do not have results that let the sender know that the
message was received - they follow the 'fire and forget' paradigm. Any results must be separately
communicated to the sender with an additional message back to the origin.Agnostic: XCM makes no assumptions about the nature of the consensus systems between which
the messages are being passed. XCM as a message format should be usable in any system that
derives finality through consensus.These four crucial design decisions allow for XCM messages to be a reliable yet convenient way to
properly convey the intentions from one consensus system to another without any compatibility
issues.noteXCM is constantly in development - meaning the format is expected to change over time. XCM v3 is the
latest version, and is deployed on Polkadot.
To view updates on the XCM format, visit the
xcm-format repository to view any RFCs that have been
submitted that would contribute to the next release.A Format, Not a Protocol​What started as an approach to cross-chain communication, has evolved into a format for
Cross-Consensus Communication that is not
only conducted between chains, but also between smart contracts, pallets, bridges, and even sharded
enclaves like SPREE.XCM cannot actually send messages between systems. It is a format for how message transfer should be
performed, similar to how RESTful services use REST as an architectural style of development, where
HTTP requests contain specific parameters to perform some action.Similar to UDP, out of the box XCM is a ""fire and forget"" model, unless there is a separate XCM
message designed to be a response message which can be sent from the recipient to the sender. All
error handling should also be done on the recipient side.infoXCM is not designed in a way where every system supporting the format is expected to be able to
interpret any possible XCM message. Practically speaking, one can imagine that some messages will
not have reasonable interpretations under some systems or will be intentionally unsupported.Furthermore, it's essential to realize that XCM messages by themselves are not considered
transactions. XCM describes how to change the state of the target network, but the message by itself
doesn't perform the state change.This partly ties to what is called asynchronous composability, which allows XCM messages to
bypass the concept of time-constrained mechanisms, like on-chain scheduling and execution over time
in the correct order in which it was intended.XCM Tech Stack​XCM can be used to express the meaning of the messages over each of these three communication
channels.Core Functionality of XCM​XCM opens the doors to a multi-hop, multi-network communications.XCM introduces some key features and additions to cross-consensus messaging, including:Programmability - the ability to have expectations for messages, which allow for more
comprehensive use cases, safe dispatches for version checking, branching, and NFT/Asset support.Functional Multichain Decomposition - the ability to define mechanisms to cross-reference and
perform actions on other chains on behalf of the origin chain (remote locking), context/id for
these messages, and asset namespacing.Bridging - introduces the concept of a universal location, which allows for a base reference
for global consensus systems for multi-hop setups. This location is above the parent relay chain
or other consensus systems like Ethereum or Bitcoin.A core part of the vision that XCM provides is improving communication between the chains to make
system parachains a reality. For example, the Polkadot relay chain handles more than just
parachain management and shared security - it handles user balances/assets, auctions, governance,
and staking. Ideally, the relay chain should be for what it's intended to be - a place for shared
security. System parachains can alleviate these core responsibilities from the relay chain but only
by using a standard format like XCM.This is where system parachains come in, where each of these core responsibilities can be delegated
to a system parachain respectively.infoXCM bridging, functional multichain decomposition, and programmability upgrades are crucial to
bringing ecosystems together using a common communication abstraction.For more information on the specific intructions used for these key features, head over to the
instructions and registers page.Cross-Consensus Message Format (XCM Format)​For an updated and complete description of the cross-consensus message format please see the

By accessing the ultimate, open, and universal cross-chain DEX protocol based on Substrate, Zenlink DEX Protocol enables all parachains to build DEX and achieve liquidity sharing in one click. Zenlink DEX Protocol includes Module, WASM, and EVM implementations, which are flexible and adaptable, allowing for customizable compositions and interoperability with different DeFi modules. In addition, the Zenlink DEX Aggregator connects all DEX DApps on Polkadot and aggregates liquidity, providing a low slippage trading experience for users. Zenlink DEX Composable Hub enables developers to access the Zenlink DEX Module to build their own unique DEXs, forming a DEX composable hub for the Polkadot ecosystem. Zenlink DEX Network architecture can be described as follows.Zenlink DEX Protocol is an underlying cross-chain DEX protocol based on Substrate, which includes Module, WASM, and EVM implementations. Zenlink DEX Module is a module that can be inserted into parachain code through Pallet. The module will be integrated into parachains, so that they can directly have the basic functions of DEX without repeated development, such as Swap, creating transaction pairs, adding/removing liquidity, etc.; at the same time, it can also share liquidity with all parachains integrated with Zenlink DEX Module. Zenlink DEX WASM refers to the version of the WASM contract written with ink! Pallet. The advantage of this implementation is that the smart contract can be compiled and deployed to the parachain ink! module, instead of modifying the source code of the parachain. WASM is the native contract implementation in the Polkadot network and is the primary contract deployment method of the future, and the Zenlink DEX WASM version has the ability to be deployed to the WASM contract parachain for the first time. Zenlink DEX EVM is a contractual deployment mode to achieve compatibility with the Ethereum virtual machine (EVM), and it is also a transition scheme adopted by the Polkadot network in the initial stage. The Zenlink DEX EVM version implements all the functions of the protocol layer, complements the perfect testing process, and can be deployed to the EVM contract parachain for the first time, which greatly expands the applicability of the platform. Zenlink DApp is a front-end interactive product based on Zenlink DEX Protocol to facilitate users to use cross-chain DEX without awareness. Zenlink Network Token (ZLK) is the native token of the Zenlink network, serving the participants of the entire Zenlink DEX network. It provides a fair and transparent governance mechanism and significant utility within the ecosystem, and is used to motivate eco-users to participate in the network development in the long term.Zenlink Network EcosystemZenlink network ecosystem participants consist of the following categories. Liquidity providers: provides liquidity for trading pairs on the Zenlink DEX network. Traders: users who make trades on Zenlink DEX. Governance users: users who obtain ZLK and participate in network governance in a variety of ways. Developers: developers involved in the Zenlink network. Parachains: parachains integrating Zenlink DEX Module Zenlink is committed to providing valuable protocols, products, and services, and the development of its ecosystem depends on the joint efforts of the above participants. At the same time, Zenlink will continue to invest the value created by the network into ecosystem construction, encourage more contributors to participate in network construction, promote optimization and upgrading at all levels of the network, and then create greater value, making the whole network enter the development track of positive feedback. And ZLK is the most important medium to promote the whole eco-economic cycle.Token UtilityThe native cryptographically-secured fungible protocol token of Zenlink (ticker symbol ZLK) is a transferable representation of attributed governance and utility functions specified in the protocol/code of Zenlink, and which is designed to be used solely as an interoperable utility token thereon.ZLK provides the economic incentives which will be distributed to encourage users to exert efforts towards contribution and participation in the ecosystem on Zenlink, thereby creating a mutually beneficial system where every participant is fairly compensated for its efforts. ZLK is an integral and indispensable part of Zenlink, because without ZLK, there would be no incentive for users to expend resources to participate in activities or provide services for the benefit of the entire ecosystem on Zenlink. Given that additional ZLK will be awarded to a user based only on its actual usage, activity and efforts made on Zenlink and/or proportionate to the frequency and volume of transactions, users of Zenlink and/or holders of ZLK which did not actively participate will not receive any ZLK incentives.ZLK does not in any way represent any shareholding, participation, right, title, or interest in the Company, the Distributor, their respective affiliates, or any other company, enterprise or undertaking, nor will ZLK entitle token holders to any promise of fees, dividends, revenue, profits or investment returns, and are not intended to constitute securities in Singapore or any relevant jurisdiction. ZLK may only be utilised on Zenlink, and ownership of ZLK carries no rights, express or implied, other than the right to use ZLK as a means to enable usage of and interaction within Zenlink.ZLK is a utility token with multiple practical utility values, including:1. Trading mining weight value bonusZLK functions as a loyalty membership point which embeds a licence granting active participants exclusive access to selected products or services, so users will be classified into different loyalty tiers based on the amount of ZLK held, user activity and volume of transactions, with each variable weighted based on the ""tradingContributionValue"" formula. The premium membership tiers would allow users to get greater access to the network features and more preferential terms. The calculation formula for trading mining is as follows:tradingContributionValue=d×r×tradingVolume0.8tradingContributionValue=d×r×tradingVolume^{0.8}tradingContributionValue=d×r×tradingVolume0.8reward=m×(tradingContributionValuetotalTradingContributionValue)reward=m×(\frac{tradingContributionValue}{totalTradingContributionValue})reward=m×(totalTradingContributionValuetradingContributionValue​)d_ weight value of the ZLK holdings, see the table below for detailsr_ trading pair weight value, see the table below for detailsm_ indicates the total incentives in the periodtradingVolume_ indicates the amount of a single trade, denominated in stablecoinsNote: tradingVolume does not count all transactions. Every 5 minutes will be a statistical period, for each address, only the one with the highest transaction volume within 5 minutes will be counted, the rest of the transactions will not be counted. If there are multiple transactions with the same maximum value at the same address within 5 minutes, only one transaction will be counted. For example: If address A has 3 transactions in 5 minutes, 100 USDT, 1,000 USDT, and 10,000 USDT respectively, then its tradingVolume is 10,000 USDT and tradingContributionValue is 100 in these 5 minutes. Similarly, if address B has 2 transactions in 5 minutes, 5,000 USDT, and 50,000 USDT respectively, then its tradingVolume is 50,000 USDT and tradingContributionValue is 223.61 in these 5 minutes2. Active User IncentivesUsers may receive ZLK rewards by actively participating in activities on Zenlink, for example utilising the platform, providing liquidity, or participating in governance.3. GovernanceTo promote decentralized community governance for the network, ZLK would allow holders to initiate and vote on ZIP (Zenlink Improve Proposal) to determine future features and/or parameters of Zenlink, with voting weight calculated in proportion to the tokens staked (the right to vote is restricted solely to voting on features of Zenlink; it does not entitle ZLK holders to vote on the operation and management of the Company, its affiliates, or their assets or the disposition of such assets to token holders, or select the board of directors of these entities, or determine the development direction of these entities, does not constitute any equity interest in any of these entities or any collective investment scheme; the arrangement is not intended to be any form of joint venture or partnership). For example, ZLK holders may vote on suggestions for the improvement of Zenlink products, allocatn of the treasury to development or community building efforts.Economic MechanismIn order to promote network growth and ensure a healthy cycle of the entire ecosystem, Zenlink designed the following economic mechanisms for ZLK: Liquidity MiningZenlink is currently a DEX based on AMM (automatic market maker) model. It is crucial for DEXs to have a broad and deep liquidity pool in order to create markets for users to trade their tokens, so Zenlink has established a liquidity incentive program. Token holders can obtain the LP Token of the corresponding trading pair by providing liquidity to the Zenlink DEX network. The LP Token represents the voucher to add and remove liquidity, and liquidity incentives can be obtained by staking LP Token with Zenlink to record their contribution to the liquidity pool, and accordingly the liquidity provider will be entitled to receive ZLK rewards. The liquidity mining reward shall be distributed periodically, as detailed in the announcement or program of liquidity mining launched in the future. It is important to reiterate that a liquidity pool simply comprises a set of autonomous smart contracts deployed on the relevant blockchain network, operated directly by users calling functions on it (which allows them to interact with other users and/or pool their own selected assets in a peer-to-peer manner). There is no further control by or interaction with the original entity which had deployed the smart contract (which entity solely functions as a provider of technical tools for users, and is not offering any sort of securities product or regulated service).Trading MiningUsers who trade with DEX can also get ZLK token incentives proportionate to their activity. Considering the fairness of participating users, there will be a balance between users with different trading volumes in the design of the mechanism. The incentive for transaction mining comes from two parts: 10% of the transaction fee income (rebate) and 15% of the initial ZLK allocation. The reward is distributed according to the proportion of the contribution value of the transaction volume in a certain period, calculation formula reference [Token Utility-Trading mining weight value bonus].Transaction Fee Fund PoolThe transaction fee will be managed in a dedicated fund pool. At present, the maximum transaction fee is 0.3% of the amount of each transaction, and depending on the actual situation, the transaction fee charged on different parachains may be in different tokens, so there are theoretically multiple tokens in the transaction fee fund pool. The main uses of transaction fees include: ZLK liquidity provider share: 50% Active user incentives: 30% Traders share: 10%Reservation share: 10%Community Incentives PoolUsers may receive ZLK rewards by actively participating in activities on Zenlink, for example utilising the platform, providing liquidity, or participating in governance. 5% of the total supply of ZLK tokens is reserved to reward active community contributors and parachains that promote adoption by integrating Zenlink DEX Module.DAO TreasuryThis part of the token is reserved for 5% of the total supply and is jointly managed by DAO members to support the development of the Zenlink network. Its expenditure purposes include, but are not limited to: Zenlink marketing or community-building activities. Rewards to DAO members based on the proof of workload.Developer Grant.*We will publish a separate document on the model design of Zenlink NFTZLK DistributionZenlink will issue the same set of ZLK Token in Kusama Network and Polkadot Network with a maximum supply of 100 million. Due to the buyback mechanism, there will be a certain degree of deflation, and the actual maximum circulation will be less than 100 million. The token distribution ratio of the two networks is tentatively 40% of Kusama issuance and 60% of Polkadot issuance, following the same distribution rules (i.e. 40,000,000 ZLK issued on the Kusama network and 60,000,000 ZLK issued on the Polkadot network, which will follow a non-discriminatory release rule). The specific distribution is as follows: Community: 50%, of which: Trading mining: 15%, non-linear unlockedLiquidity mining: 25%, non-linear unlockedDAO Treasury: 5%, used on demand for network construction expenses and is jointly controlled by the community and Zenlink team. Community Incentives: 5%, which is used to reward ZLK active community contributors and parachains that integrate Zenlink DEX Module.Early investors: 26%, of which:Seed round: 7%, linearly unlocked every 3 months, 1/8 unlocked each timeAngel round: 11%, linearly unlocked every 2 months, 1/8 unlocked each time Series A Round: 8%, linearly unlocked every month, 1/8 unlocked each timeTeam: 20%, linearly unlocked every 3 months and released in 24 months (No unlocking for the first 2 months after launch). Zenlink Foundation: 4%, reserved and there is no plan to unlock for now.Risk Statement Zenlink is currently in the initial development stages and there are a variety of unforeseeable risks. You acknowledge and agree that there are numerous risks associated with acquiring ZLK, holding ZLK, and using ZLK for participation in Zenlink. In the worst scenario, this could lead to the loss of all or part of ZLK held. IF YOU DECIDE TO ACQUIRE ZLK OR PARTICIPATE IN ZENLINK, YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE, ACCEPT AND ASSUME THE FOLLOWING RISKS:Uncertain Regulations and Enforcement Actions: The regulatory status of Zenlink, ZLK and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. The regulation of digital assets has become a primary target of regulation in all major countries in the world. It is impossible to predict how, when or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulations or create new regulations with respect to such technology and its applications, including ZLK and/or Zenlink. Regulatory actions could negatively impact ZLK and/or Zenlink in various ways. The Company, the Distributor (or their respective affiliates) may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction.Inadequate disclosure of information: As at the date hereof, Zenlink is still under development and its design concepts, consensus mechanisms, algorithms, codes, and other technical details and parameters may be constantly and frequently updated and changed. Although this Lightpaper contains the most current information relating to Zenlink, it is not absolutely complete and may still be adjusted and updated by the Zenlink team from time to time. The Zenlink team has neither the ability nor obligation to keep holders of ZLK informed of every detail (including development progress and expected milestones) regarding the project to develop Zenlink, hence insufficient information disclosure is inevitable and reasonable.Competitors: Various types of decentralised applications and networks are emerging at a rapid rate, and the industry is increasingly competitive. It is possible that alternative networks could be established that utilise the same or similar code and protocol underlying ZLK and/or Zenlink and attempt to re-create similar facilities. Zenlink may be required to compete with these alternative networks, which could negatively impact ZLK and/or Zenlink.Loss of Talent: The development of Zenlink greatly depends on the continued co-operation of the existing technical team and expert consultants, who are highly knowledgeable and experienced in their respective sectors. The loss of any member may adversely affect Zenlink or its future development. Further, stability and cohesion within the team is critical to the overall development of Zenlink. There is the possibility that conflict within the team and/or departure of core personnel may occur, resulting in negative influence on the project in the future.Failure to develop: There is the risk that the development of Zenlink will not be executed or implemented as planned, for a variety of reasons, including without limitation the event of a decline in the prices of any digital asset, virtual currency or ZLK, unforeseen technical difficulties, and shortage of development funds for activities.Security weaknesses: Hackers or other malicious groups or organisations may attempt to interfere with ZLK and/or Zenlink in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing. Furthermore, there is a risk that a third party or a member of the Company, the Distributor or their respective affiliates may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses into the core infrastructure of ZLK and/or Zenlink, which could negatively affect ZLK and/or Zenlink. Further, the future of cryptography and security innovations are highly unpredictable and advances in cryptography, or technical advances (including without limitation development of quantum computing), could present unknown risks to ZLK and/or Zenlink by rendering ineffective the cryptographic consensus mechanism that underpins that blockchain protocol.Other risks: In addition, the potential risks briefly mentioned above are not exhaustive and there are other risks (as more particularly set out in the Terms and Conditions) associated with your participation in Zenlink, as well as acquisition of, holding and use of ZLK, including those that the Company or the Distributor cannot anticipate. Such risks may further materialise as unanticipated variations or combinations of the aforementioned risks. You should conduct full due diligence on the Company, the Distributor, their respective affiliates, and the Zenlink team, as well as understand the overall framework, mission and vision for Zenlink prior to participating in the same and/or acquiring ZLK.AnnexesZenlink_Tokenomics_Page.pdf4MBPDF",Tokenomics,DEX composable hub between all Polkadot parachains.,https://app.gitbook.com/share/space/thumbnail/-Mcs9C52G4j4nqQnKPYa/page/-MkLRapVqe6J0mDKD0pN.png?color=%23F20082&logo=https%3A%2F%2F2537315574-files.gitbook.io%2F~%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252F-Mcs9C52G4j4nqQnKPYa%252Ficon%252FAVJMkk0gwqKPRK2G9BO5%252F%25E8%25B5%2584%25E6%25BA%2590%252064.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D0d25952d-7e2e-4976-a97a-4e51a79cd11a&theme=default,https://wiki.zenlink.pro/resources/tokenomics,Zenlink,docs,"zenlink, resources, tokenomics","DEX, Decentralized exchange, DeFi",Unknown Error,{}

dbc468a14b601d5d9240aeb72b9fcd2f8aed2f4e30932876edf8d16ec313846b,,"General FAQ1) What is the recommended wallet to use?All the wallets compatible with the Polkadot Ecosystem should work, however, we recommend using https://polkadot.js.org/ and SubWallet - Polkadot Extension Wallet. See here for download steps. 2) Does the Bit.County support multiple languages?We already implemented internalization in our code, however, it's in our roadmap to support multiple languages. We will offer bounties for the community who wants to offer assistance in translation.3) What is the use of NEER if we will use BIT?See here for more details. 4) Will there be ETH connection later on?Development of an Ethereum bridge is in development.5) What chains will NFT marketplace support, except DOT and KSM?At launch, only ours. Pioneer and Continuum. At some point, we will enable interoperability, and tokens that live on other chains will be tradeable on our marketplace. We simply want to make sure everything works properly before doing partnerships and opening the bi-directional XCM Channel to allow users to teleport assets from one chain to another.6) Why create a metaverse now without certainty of having lands to host it. What is the benefit? What is the added value? Why pay?Creating a Metaverse project not only allows you to build in it once you have land to deploy in it. Creating a Metaverse project will allow you to have your own Local NFT Marketplace, a way to collaborate and share information with your communities. Create DAO proposals and allow people to vote if they hold a specific token or NFT. You have Pulse, the Social/Community section that you can use to communicate with your community. Get royalties from every NFT being sold on your Metaverse project, regardless of you being the creator of the NFTs or if the creator just requested the NFTs to be sold in your Metaverse.7) Could we be sure that a metaverse created now could be exported to lands later? How many lands will be necessary?It's the opposite, Lands need to be deployed inside the Metaverse project. The 3D world can be built by deploying 1 Raw Land block, all the way up to 900 Land blocks.8) Why are we obliged to acquire NEER while we have already provided funds for NUUM? What will be our advantages as NUUM investors?We think of Bit.Country PioNEER as a more Community focused project. Whilst Continuum is more corporate-oriented. It will be more scalable, etc. You are not forced to buy $NEER if you don't want to build or create now. You can wait until $NUUM is released to put those tokens in staking or buying land to deploy on a Metaverse project minted on Continuum and use $NUUM for all the different utilities it was created for.9) Why is there a minimum of 100 $NEER in staking? We set a minimum of 100 $NEER as a protection measure to avoid spam transactions clogging the network &/or DDoS attacks. The value may be changed if a referendum passes via Governance proposal.10) What is the difference between Pioneer and Continuum? Bit.Country Pioneer is built on Kusama, the 'Canary Network' of Polkadot. The 'Canary Network' aims for projects to build with flexibility rapidly. Bit.Country Pioneer is built on Kusama. The next generation of Bit.Country Continuum will be built on the Polkadot blockchain.

By leveraging on the cross-consensus message (XCM) it can provide cross-chain liquid staking services for multiple chains.Bifrost’s mission is to provide standardized cross-chain interest-bearing derivatives for Polkadot relay chains, parachains, and heterogeneous chains bridged with Polkadot. Furthermore, by aggregating over 80% of PoS consensus chains’ staking liquidity through cross-chain derivatives, our protocol lowers users’ staking threshold, increases multi-chain staking ratio, and improves the ecosystems application interest base, by creating a three-way positive cycle for the StakeFi ecosystem by empowering users, multi-chains, and ecosystem applications.You can find roadmap the current updates for roadmap 2023 (https://bifrost-finance.notion.site/7df6abf2acb54b398df75230e157c7da?v=02ecfe941c5242c3b5f8c77654512b80) Docs (https://wiki.bifrost.finance/) Twitter (https://twitter.com/bifrost_finance) Telegram (https://t.me/bifrost_finance) Telegram announcement channel (https://t.me/bifrost_announcements) Discord (https://discord.gg/8DRBw2h5X4) Web (https://bifrost.finance/) Github (https://github.com/bifrost-finance)Ecosystem : Bifrost dApp (https://bifrost.app/) Polkadot Substrate portal (https://dash.bifrost.finance/#/explorer) Subscan/Substrate based blockchain explorer (https://bifrost.subscan.io/) Bifrost Subsquare (https://bifrost.subsquare.io/) Bifrost Analytics (https://stats.bifrost.app/) Liebi pool (https://pool.liebi.com/eth)Q: Why the  Bifrost name ?In Norse mythology, Bifröst (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifr%C3%B6st) is a burning rainbow bridge that reaches between Midgard (Earth) and Asgard, the realm of the gods. The bridge is attested as Bilröst in the Poetic Edda; compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and as Bifröst in the Prose Edda; written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson, and in the poetry of skalds. According to the Prose Edda, the bridge ends in heaven at Himinbjörg, the residence of the god Heimdallr, who guards it from the jötnar. The bridge's destruction during Ragnarök by the forces of Muspell is foretold. Scholars have proposed that the bridge may have originally represented the Milky Way and have noted parallels between the bridge and another bridge in Norse mythology, Gjallarbrú.Q: Why do i find two Bifrost companies ?

However, vDOT can be used for liquidity mining and collateral, and also requires learning how to choose nodes and optimizing node selection strategies for maximum profits.Q: When participating in staking through Bifrost, why are the staking rewards higher than staking directly on Polkadot? Is it compounded? How can it be compounded?Bifrost optimizes node selection algorithms, automatically balances node voting, and maintains the best node selection strategy. vToken is compounded. The staking rewards received by SLP are first calculated based on the ratio of vToken and token and then the vToken exchange rate is adjusted upwards. The staking rewards are then staked again into nodes, which means that vToken is compounded. Holding vToken allows one to earn compounded returns.Q: What comprises the vToken earnings? How is it distributed, and what is its composability?vToken earnings consist of basic earnings and derivative earnings. Basic earnings refer to staking rewards, and the latest version of the Bifrost DApp shows the daily earnings. Derivative earnings refer to the additional earnings generated by using vToken elsewhere, such as 5.2% liquidity mining for vDOT. The derivative earnings depend on how vToken is used, and it is not tracked on the Bifrost DApp.Q: Will vToken be maliciously inflated? How to prevent malicious inflation?The issuance of bifrost vToken is constrained by code, and artificial inflation is impossible. When tokens are minted, corresponding vToken is minted. The security of the code is ensured by multiple code audit companies, internal cross-team audits, real-time monitoring of issuance and reserve amounts, and emergency processing plans.Q: Why can't vToken earnings be withdrawn separately?vToken earnings can be withdrawn separately. For example, if 100 DOT is used to mint 100 vDOT today, after one week, 100 vDOT is equivalent to 105 DOT. You can redeem 4.76 vDOT = 5 DOT, and the remaining 95.24 vDOT is still equivalent to 100 DOT. You can also automate this process through OAK or other parachain.Regarding SecurityQ: How does Bifrost ensure the security of funds, including contract security, non-custodial security, and whether there will be slashing penalties? How does Bifrost protect assets if the project team runs away?Bifrost's code is open-source and transparent, and the security of funds is ensured by code constraints, which cannot be controlled by humans, establishing trust through blockchain. 1. Multiple code audit companies audit the code. 2. Internal cross-team audits. 3. Real-time monitoring of issuance and reserve amounts. 4. Emergency processing plans. Slash penalties are possible, and the Bifrost white paper defines three ways to deal with it: 1. 20% of vToken commission revenue enters the vToken Slash public insurance fund. 2. BNC reserves 5% of tokens as protocol insurance funds. 3. If the public insurance fund and protocol insurance fund are insufficient to compensate, the vToken exchange rate will be lowered, which is equivalent to all vToken holders sharing the compensation. The probability of a slash is low, and the amount is small. vKSM has been running for a year and a half, and there has only been one slash, which was caused by Kusama's upgrade and was ultimately canceled through governance.Check our Audit and risk assesment page for more info: Here.Regarding RedemptionQ: Why is the redemption period for vDOT shorter than the normal redemption period of 28 days for DOT staking on the Polkadot chain?The vDOT redemption has a matching function. When vToken is minted, the protocol checks whether there are people redeeming in the redemption queue. If there are, DOT will be paid to the redeeming party first instead of being used for staking. Therefore, the redemption period is less than 28 days.Regarding FarmingQ: What are the risks associated with farming in the Bifrost network? What are the risks associated with LP? Will there be impermanent loss? How to solve the problem of insufficient liquidity?There are almost no risks associated with vToken farming, and the only risk is that the overall yield is lower than the staking yield. Providing LP requires a pair of tokens, one of which does not have staking rewards. If the staking yield is higher than the farming yield, then exchanging everything for vToken yields more profits, and there are no losses. Trading fees and incentives will maintain liquidity at a relatively high level, and Bifrost will optimize the vToken trading pair algorithm to increase capital utilization.Q: When using DOT to mint vDOT, why is the ratio not 1:1? How are vToken staking rewards distributed?The vDOT price has been rising, and when vDOT is redeemed, the principal and earnings are withdrawn together.Q: What is the source of the project team's revenue?10% commission fee, 0.1% unstake fee, on-chain transaction fees. As long as the vToken issuance volume is high enough, the protocol will continue to make money.Q: Why is DOT inflation around 10%? If the funds in the treasury are not distributed in an era, will they be destroyed continuously, and can this destruction partially resist inflation?Yes, the treasury destroys 1% of the DOT balance in each era. If the treasury revenue increases and the balance increases, the amount destroyed will also increase, which can partially resist inflation.Q: The average staking yield for DOT on Polkadot.js is 15%, while the basic staking yield for vDOT is 24%. Why is Bifrost's staking yield so much higher? Is the staking reward source from the Bifrost project team? Will they run away if they cannot pay out? How to retrieve assets if they run away?vDOT earnings include basic staking earnings and derivative earnings. Basic staking earnings benefit from Bifrost's optimization algorithm for node staking and are typically 1% to 5% higher than direct staking earnings. Derivative earnings come from additional earnings generated by using vDOT elsewhere, such as liquidity provision and lending, so comprehensive earnings can reach 24%. Therefore, the high yield of vDOT is sustainable, and there is no risk of being unable to pay out. Moreover, vDOT is completely decentralized, and ownership belongs to the user. Users can interact with the blockchain at any time to retrieve assets. Here is a comparison chart from Bifrost's Polkadot Decoded presentation.Q: If there is an emergency situation with Bifrost, will my assets be affected if my DOT is staked on the Bifrost platform?DOT is staked through the Bifrost parachain's sovereign account, which has no private key and cannot be controlled unilaterally by any individual or organization. Therefore, the risk of exposure is low, unless the Bifrost parachain is completely controlled by hackers. However, it takes 28 days to withdraw DOT, and attacks can be intercepted through governance and other means. The Bifrost code has undergone multiple rounds of audits by different audit companies, and the SLP protocol has been running without incidents for nearly two years. Therefore, the probability of emergency situations is low.Regarding liquidityQ: There is a shortage of liquidity in the entire Polkadot ecosystem, especially now that the market is slowing down, and liquidity is diminishing as it flows into various parachains. How to solve the problem of insufficient liquidity?In the current market stage, the entire industry is facing a lack of liquidity, which is due to a lack of market activity and insufficient new capital. The Polkadot ecosystem can respond in two ways: 1. Aggregate liquidity as much as possible through technical means to increase capital utilization. 2. Establish a more secure and decentralized cross-chain bridge, bridge the Polkadot ecosystem with more blockchains, and introduce more liquidity. Bifrost is also building Polkadot ecosystem liquidity through these two approaches.",FAQ,Bifrost is a non-custodial liquid staking protocol built on Polkadot,"https://www.gitbook.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,dpr=2,height=640,fit=contain,format=auto/https%3A%2F%2F1423232609-files.gitbook.io%2F~%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FJFtVsA5N3spWTWKvFvv0%252Fsocialpreview%252FgbFey7cxO9k8i959C9n7%252FWiki_1280_640.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Dd99d05e4-bb67-4fda-8a47-82cb569f1051",https://docs.bifrost.finance/quick-start/faq,Bifrost,docs,"bifrost, quick start, faq","DeFi, Liquid staking, Staking",Unknown Error,{}

Therefore, nodes need to be added to the VWL of SLP to have a chance to be further selected into the delegation set of SLP. The selection and update of the Validator White List fully follow the conclusions of the Validators scoring system.

21e8f1bad60f84a976cf259b0df56f758142cf30502b6daa848750fd2a3ab24f,,"Wallet Extension FAQParallel Wallet extension is the non-custodial multi-asset native wallet solution of Parallel Finance that is developed to give users a one-stop DeFi experience.Forgot Password?  Since we don't store your password due to security reasons, it is not possible to retrieve or change your password. If you forget your password, you can create a new password by resetting your wallet extension. However please proceed with caution as by resetting the wallet extension, you will remove all wallet access via the extension. The only way to enable access via the extension is to import the wallet with its secret phrase. So before proceeding with “reset”, please make sure you have secret phrases for all your wallets.To reset your wallet extension, you will have to uninstall the extension and then reinstall it. You will then be prompted to create a new password step. Once the new password is set up, you can import all your existing wallets back to the extension by providing the secret phrases of each existing wallet. How do I use Parallel Wallet to interact with dApps? There are 2 types of dApp interactions you can do with your Parallel Wallet:1.Authorize dApps to gain access to your Parallel Wallet: when you interact with the dApp for the first time, you would be asked by the dApp if you authorize it to access your public key and see your wallet balances and activity. By clicking “accept” or “reject”, you would give or refuse access to your wallet balances and activity. 2.Sign transaction request with your Parallel Wallet: If you connect your Parallel Wallet with the dApp, each time you trigger a transaction from the dApp, it would send a transaction request to your Parallel Wallet. By clicking “confirm” or “reject” the transaction request, you would be able to either sign the transaction so it can be broadcasted onto the blockchain or reject the transaction request.At all times, you can manage your granted authorization to the dApps from “connected Apps” within the “wallet settings” page. It is important to mention that having multiple wallets connected to a dApp using the same Connect Wallet Flow may lead to the poor performance of the dApp (it may become slow or even crash). As such, when interacting with dApps, it is also recommended to use only one wallet (e.g.Parallel Wallet Extension) for the best consistent communication performance between the wallet and the dApps.What happens if I use the wrong wallet address to send or receive crypto?While Parallel Wallet is a non-custodial wallet, giving you complete control over your digital assets, this also means that we're not able to recover any funds sent or received to an incorrect address. We strongly suggest that you double-check addresses before sending or receiving crypto through Wallet.Can I lose access to my funds?Parallel Wallet generates a 12-word Secret Phrase, also referred to as a ""seed or recovery phrase,"" that you and only you have access to. This means that if you lose your secret phrase, you will lose access to your Parallel Wallet. Please keep in mind that Parallel will never have access to this recovery phrase, so we cannot move funds on your behalf or help you access your digital assets. As the security best practice, we strongly encourage you to back up your recovery phrase and store it in a secure location. The balance is different between the “Overview” page of Parallel dApps and Parallel Wallet balance? If you are a user of Parallel dApps, you may sometimes see small discrepancies between the “Overview” page of Parallel dApps and the wallet balance of your Parallel Wallet. This is normal as the sources of the two balances are different:“Overview” page of Parallel dApps: it gets the real-time price directly from Parallel / Heiko networks.Parallel Wallet balance: it gets the historical price from the internal pricing service. You may therefore experience a delay of 30 sec. - 1 min. of pricing delay.Does Parallel Wallet hold my funds? No, Parallel Wallet doesn’t hold your funds. Your funds are not within the Parallel Wallet extension. They are on the blockchain network itself. The wallet extension just enables you to access an address and make transactions out of it by using your Recovery Phrase.When you create a wallet, you will be given a Secret Phrase. And this is where your Private Keys are encrypted. An industry-standard allows the use of simple words to be used rather than a set of alphanumeric characters. It’s much easier to back up. You can therefore also access your funds on any other decentralized wallet by using your Recovery Phrase.Last modified 4mo ago",Wallet Extension FAQ,"DeFi protocol with liquid staking and crowdloan, AMM, money market, DAO FI, and farming.",https://app.gitbook.com/share/space/thumbnail/qLyt1dwQXdURWrvJ7vFw/page/CrcYS471ZSQ4dpRpneAI.png,https://docs.parallel.fi/parallel-wallet/wallet-extension-faq,Parallel Finance,docs,"parallel, parallel wallet, wallet extension faq","DeFi, LST, Liquid staking, AMM, Automated market maker",Unknown Error,{}

How to Install Wallet The first step toward interacting with the Parallel Wallet is to download and install the extension directly:Via Chrome Web Store using Google ChromeAfter successful installation of the wallet, you will see the icon at the top bar.In case it is not visible on the bar, click on the extension and pin it.Upon successful installation, the page below will open when you click Parallel wallet extension.How to Create a Wallet1.Parallel Finance holds the security of its products with utmost importance. To get started with wallet creation, you’ll first need to create a password. The password helps to secure your wallet(s) and you’ll need it every time you want to access your wallet(s). For this, you’ll follow the following steps:Enter your desired password - It must contain at least one symbol and one number.Confirm the password by entering it the second time.Check the terms and conditions box and click the confirm button to create your password.Note: Make sure to write down and store your password in a secure location.To protect your assets, you'll need to enter your password after 15 minutes of inactivity or exiting the wallet.2. Next, if you’re a new user, create your first wallet by clicking Create New Wallet.After clicking the ""create new wallet” button, you will be directed to the seed phrase page.

However, participants will get cDOT, which they can use to stay liquid.​3.When will I get my PARA tokens?You will receive your PARA tokens after Parallel Finance wins a parachain slot, launch, and allows the transfer of tokens.​4.Which wallets can I use to participate?Polkadot{.js}​5.What happens if Parallel Finance doesn't win the first auction, what happens to my DOT?If Parallel Finance does not win the first auction, it will continue to bid at subsequent auctions. In total, there are 5 auctions in the first batch of slots.​How to participate1.I’m currently staking my DOT - what do I need to do?You should unstake your DOT. The guide «How to unstake DOT on Polkadot{.js}» is here.​2. Will my DOT be refunded after the end of the blockhain lease?Parallel’s auction loan participants can redeem cDOT they hold after the Parallel Finance lease expires for an equivalent amount of DOT (the ratio of cDOT to DOT is 1:1).​3.Can I withdraw my DOT from crowdloan?No. All applications for participation in the crowdloan module are final and cannot be withdrawn, but you will get cDOT which you can sell.​How does cDOT work?1.When will I get cDOT?When users contribute to the auction loan platform, we issue cDOT and it has utility.​2. If I sell my cDOT, will I be able to get my contribution to the DOT at the end of the lease spent?Participants who have made a contribution must hold the cDOT at the end of the lease spent in order to exchange their cDOT for DOT. If these participants no longer own cDOT, they will not be able to exchange them for DOT.​3. If I sell my cDOT, will I be able to receive PARA awards?Yes. If you make a DOT contribution to Parallel Finance, you will receive PARA rewards. The sale of the cDOT does not affect your PARA rewards.4. Does cDOT have a vesting period?Users are able to receive cDOT after Parallel’s parachain launches. The cDOT is immediately transferrable and can be used for different types of DeFi applications on Parallel’s platform.​Parallel Token DistributionUp to 12.5% will be split among all of the contributors in the parachain auction, and released according to a linear vesting schedule if/when Parallel wins a Polkadot parachain auction. The remaining 2.5% will be distributed in future crowdloans.The crowd loan contribution is soft capped at 20M DOT (with a hard cap at 30M DOT) and will allocate 15% of the total supply (1.5B PARA tokens) as rewards and bonuses. The minimum guarantee is 25 PARA if you use Polkadot{.js}. However, if you use Parallel platform, you will get 33 PARA tokens per DOT contributed. PARA vestingUp to 15% will be split among all of the contributors in the parachain auction, and released according to a linear vesting schedule if/when Parallel wins a Polkadot parachain auction. The crowdloan contribution is soft capped at 20M DOT (with a hard cap at 40M DOT) and will allocate 12.5% of the total supply (1.5B PARA tokens) as rewards and bonuses another 2.5% will be distributed in future crowdloans. The minimum guarantee is 20 PARA if you use Polkadot{.js}. However, if you use Parallel platform, you will get minimum of 33 PARA tokens per DOT contributed. The tokens rewarded will be vested linearly across a two years time frame. This means that every block, a proportion of PARA rewards will be unlocked, and the user can claim them at any time. There is no cliff in the crowdloan vesting, so the distribution will occur evenly, every day and month.​Parallel’s auction loan1.How does vesting work?Users can participate in any crowdloan projects through Parallel’s platform.The tokens rewarded will be vested linearly across a two year time frame.

As such, the project is moving at a fast pace and as we roll out new products and add new assets, we deem it fit to develop a glossary of terms to help our users get started and learn all the important information about the project, its architecture, assets, bridge, wallet, and other key technical features.AMM: Automated Market Maker - ​​a substrate-based pallet that enables decentralized (non-custodial) and autonomous trading or exchange of assets. This autonomous trading mechanism removes the need for centralized third parties like exchanges, trading platforms, and financial entities and allows users to trade assets against liquidity pools without relying on any of these intermediaries.Auction: The method used by projects to win a parachain slot from the relaychainBridge: A substrate-based pallet that acts as an intermediary that connects the Polkadot and Kusama Relaychain and parachains. It allow seamless interoperability and fluidity between them by enabling token transfer, data exchange, and feedback flow between the independent platforms.Council: an elected body of on-chain accounts that represents the passive stakeholders of Parallel and/or Heiko. The council has two major tasks in governance: proposing referenda and vetoing dangerous or malicious referenda.Crowdloan: A method used by projects to temporarily source tokens to win an auction for a parachain slot from a relaychain. The tokens that are gathered in this way and rewards are programmatically returned to the lender after the lease period is over or the crowdloan period ends.Lease Period: The amount of time that a parachain can connect to the relaychain.Liquid Staking: A method of staking where users receive a derivative form of their staked asset to help them remain liquid. The derivative asset can be used the same way the underlying asset is used and it help users have better capital efficiency and compound their reward.Liquidity: An essential part of the DeFi ecosystem that is made up of a collection of assets locked in substrate-based pallet that facilitates decentralized trading, lending and farming.Money Market: A DeFi protocol that allow users to put their idle assets to work — enabling them to borrow money by supplying collateral to the market and allowing others to deposit (lend) their assets to earn yield and compound their rewards.Nominated Proof-of-Stake (nPOS): The type of Proof-of-Stake system used by Parallel Finance where nominators back validators with their own stake as a show of faith in the good behavior of the validator. nPOS differs from the more generic concept - Delegated Proof-of-Stake in that nominators are subject to loss of stake if they nominate a bad validator; delegators are not subject to loss of stake based on the behavior of the validator.Nominators: Accounts that select a set of validators to nominate by staking their tokens. By appointing their stake, they are able to elect active set of validators and share in the rewards that are paid out. They are the second set of participants in the relaychain staking subsystem.Off-chain: Refers to activities e.g transaction that takes place outside of the blockchain or not publicly accessible.On-chain: Refers to activities e.g transactions that occurs on the blockchain, and the blockchain status is modified to reflect the occurrence and validity of the transaction.Oracle: Any tool that provides aggregated price information about a given asset.Pallet: A Turing-complete Substrate runtime module that functions in a similar way as a smart contract.Polkadot JS: a collection of tools that interfaces with the Polkadot blockchain in a granular way. It includes a browser extension, UI, API, and other apps.Parachain:  A custom, project-specific blockchain that meets several characteristics that allow it to work within the confines of the Host (Relaychain). It is also known as “parallelized chain.”Relaychain: The source blockchain that coordinates consensus and communication between parachains (and external chains, via bridges) and lends security to them. These relaychains are Polkadot and Kusama networks.Slashing: The removal of a percentage of a staked asset (DOT or KSM) as a punishment when a validator misbehaves e.g attacks the network, runs modified software, or remains offline for an extended period. The slashed asset is added to the treasury. In a situation where slashing occurred due to a faulty runtime causing forcing validators offline through no fault of their own, the slashed asset may be reversed.Staking: The method by which blockchain protocols that use the Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism validate transactions, create new blocks, and secure the blockchain network. Users supply their assets for a certain period of time and are rewarded for helping to secure the network.Treasury: a pot of funds collected through a portion of block production rewards, transaction fees, slashing, staking inefficiencies, etc.Tokens: ​​A digital currency that represents a tradable asset on a blockchain. Parallel network accommodates several tokens with different utilities within its ecosystem. They include: PARA - Parallel token, the native token of the Polkadot network-based Parallel Finance parachain. It is used for governance, network security, and execution of functionalities on the protocol's DeFi Dapp suite. HKO - Heiko token, the native token of Heiko protocol, the Kusama-based sister parachain of Parallel Finance. It is used across the different products in the Heiko super dapp suite - Staking, AMM, Cross-Chain Bridge, Money Market, etc. DOT - The DOT token is Polkadot’s native token. It can be used for governance over the network, staking, and bonding, as well as for paying fees. KSM - The KSM token is Kusama’s native token. It can be used for governance over the network, staking, and bonding, as well as for paying fees.sKSM - Staked Kusama, this is the minted derivative version of the KSM that is supplied to the Heiko staking pallet. It can be redeemed to KSM at a 1:1 ratio and it can be used as collateral, farm yield, and supplied to the platform’s money market to compound rewards. cKSM - Crowdloan Kusama, this is the minted derivative version of the KSM that is supplied to the Heiko Crowdloan pallet. It can be redeemed to KSM at a 1:1 ratio and it can be used as collateral, farm yield, and supplied to the platform’s money market to compound rewards. The numbers next to cKSM, e.g cKSM-20/27 represent the batch of the cKSM cDOT- Crowdloan DOT, this is the minted derivative version of the DOT that is supplied to the Parallel Crowdloan pallet. It can be redeemed to DOT at a 1:1 ratio and it can be used as collateral, farm yield, and supplied to the platform’s money market to compound rewards. The numbers next to cDOT, e.g cDOT-2/17 represent the batch of the cDOT sDOT - Staked DOT, this is the minted derivative version of the DOT that is supplied to the Parallel staking pallet. It can be redeemed to DOT at a 1:1 ratio and it can be used as collateral, farm yield, and supplied to the platform’s money market to compound rewards.Unbond: The process of unstaking your asset. Once the unbond waiting period elapses, the relaychain will transfer the unstaked asset to Parallel, and it will be available for withdrawal.Validators: A node that secures the relaychain via staking DOT or KSM, validate proofs from collators on parachains and vote on consensus along with other validators. They are active participants in the relaychain staking subsystem.Wallet: A wallet allows you to send, receive, hold and monitor your cryptocurrency asset. However, it is based on cryptographic principles and uses blockchain to send, receive and store transaction information.Yield Farm: An investment strategy in DeFi that involves locking or staking your tokens to get rewards in the form of transaction fees or interest. It is similar to earning interest on the money you keep in your bank account.Last modified 4mo ago",Glossary,"DeFi protocol with liquid staking and crowdloan, AMM, money market, DAO FI, and farming.",https://app.gitbook.com/share/space/thumbnail/qLyt1dwQXdURWrvJ7vFw/page/CrcYS471ZSQ4dpRpneAI.png,https://docs.parallel.fi/parallel-finance-polkadot-app/parallel-product-guides/glossary,Parallel Finance,docs,"parallel, parallel finance polkadot app, parallel product guides, glossary","DeFi, LST, Liquid staking, AMM, Automated market maker",Unknown Error,{}

This defines the price of the asset and provides liquidity to facilitate trade. Initially, users can swap PARA, DOT, and cDOT and add liquidity to DOT/PARA, cDOT6–13/PARA, DOT/cDOT6–13, DOT/cDOT7–14 pools to earn yield. Other liquidity pools will be added in due course so that our users can have a robust earning stream.PurposeEarn YieldSwap for PARA, DOT, or cDOTAccess the AMM here: https://app.parallel.fi/swap/​To use our AMM is to swap assets in a permissionless fashion.1. Connect WalletIn this initial release, you will be able to swap PARA, DOT or cDOT and add two of them to a liquidity pool to earn yield. As always, to get started, you will want to click the “Connect Wallet” button at the top right-hand corner.2. Once your wallet is approved, you will see an interface with Swap and Liquidity tabs.On Swap, you can exchange:PARA for DOT or cDOT6–13DOT for PARA or cDOT6–13 or cDOT7–14cDOT6–13 for DOT or PARAcDOT7–14 for DOTYou should see the balance for either of the tokens you have and exchange it for the other option.3. Insert how much you would like to swap.*Be sure to leave enough PARA or DOT or cDOT for Transaction Fees listed just under the swap button.Once you have accepted the fees, your wallet will open up and ask you to sign/approve the transaction. Upon approval, you will see a Transaction success notification on the top right-hand corner, near the wallet.4. To participate in our liquidity pool, you need both PARA and DOT and cDOT. Swap out a portion of your PARA or DOT or cDOT prior as both token contributions must be equal.Now you’ll be able to see the details of the liquidity addition. Here you will see how many liquidity pool tokens you will receive, as well as your contribution percentage of said pool. Below the confirm button, you will see the transaction fee for adding liquidity.5. After assessing the fees and rewards, click the confirm button.​​6. Next, confirm the transaction by clicking the ‘sign the transaction’ button from the pop-up window.Shortly after, a success message will appear confirming your addition to the liquidity pool.With Parallel’s easy-to-use and straightforward interface, users can execute swaps and add liquidity in less than 5 minutes.7. To view how much liquidity you have provided click “My Dashboard.”​​8. You will now see the different pools you have contributed to and select “Manage” next to the one you would like to see details for.​​Here you can add or withdraw liquidity.To withdraw simply select “Withdraw.”​​After withdraw, as always, “Sign the transaction.”​​Once confirmed, a 'Transaction Success' message will appear in the top right corner.Last modified 4mo ago",AMM Guide,"DeFi protocol with liquid staking and crowdloan, AMM, money market, DAO FI, and farming.",https://app.gitbook.com/share/space/thumbnail/qLyt1dwQXdURWrvJ7vFw/page/CrcYS471ZSQ4dpRpneAI.png,https://docs.parallel.fi/parallel-finance-polkadot-app/parallel-product-guides/amm-guide,Parallel Finance,docs,"parallel, parallel finance polkadot app, parallel product guides, amm guide","DeFi, LST, Liquid staking, AMM, Automated market maker",Unknown Error,{}

This is the next development to upgrade the currently simplistic design of determination of the LP token’s liquidation threshold.Again, let’s discuss this section in the arch of the following scenario: ETH is at $1000. The user provides liquidity of 1 ETH and 1596.12 USDT within the $500-1500 price range. Furthermore, the liquidation threshold of ETH is 80%.1.First, we calculate the liquidation risk margin implied by the ETH liquidation threshold. The liquidation risk margin denotes the margin that covers the potential loss in the case that actual liquidation proceeds are not enough to cover the loan. Therefore, the liquidation risk margin is calculated as:LRM=100%−liq_thldliq_thldLRM=\frac{100\%-liq\_thld}{liq\_thld} LRM=liq_thld100%−liq_thld​where liq_thldliq\_thldliq_thld denotes the liquidation threshold. Therefore, we calculate the liquidation risk margin of ETH as:LRMETH=100%−80%80%=25%\begin{aligned} LRM_{ETH}&=\frac{100\%-80\%}{80\%} \\ &=25\% \end{aligned}LRMETH​​=80%100%−80%​=25%​This means, that when liquidation is triggered for a loan collateralized by ETH, as long as the liquidation proceeds do not fall 25% below the ETH price when liquidation is triggered, the liquidation proceeds will be enough to cover the loan and the platform stays solvent.Note here the numeraire is changed to the price of ETH when liquidation is triggered, which is consistent with the measure under which the health factor is calculated at the time liquidation is triggered.2.Second, we calibrate the water level ETH price (PwP_wPw​). The water level ETH price is defined as the ETH price such that the LP position value equals to that of the loan.VLP(Pw)−Vloan=0 V_{LP}(P_w)-V_{loan}=0 VLP​(Pw​)−Vloan​=0VLP=X(Pw)∗Pw+Y(Pw)V_{LP}=X(P_w)*P_w+Y(P_w) VLP​=X(Pw​)∗Pw​+Y(Pw​)where X(Pw)X(P_w)X(Pw​) and Y(Pw)Y(P_w)Y(Pw​) denote the numbers of XXX and YYY tokens redeemable from the LP position when the underlying X asset price is PwP_wPw​. Note in this context, Y token is the stablecoin (i.e. USDT, USDC or DAI). And as defined in Uniswap V3 LP Token Analyzer, X(Pw)X(P_w)X(Pw​) and Y(Pw)Y(P_w)Y(Pw​) can be rearranged as below:{Y(Pw)=max⁡(0,L∗(min⁡(Pw,Pb)−Pa))X(Pw)=max⁡(0,L∗(1max⁡(Pw,Pa)−1Pb))\begin{cases} Y(P_w)=\max\left(0,L*\left(\sqrt{\min(P_w,P_b)}-\sqrt{P_a}\right)\right) \\ X(P_w)=\max\left(0,L*\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\max(P_w,P_a)}}-\frac{1}{\sqrt{P_b}}\right)\right) \end{cases} ⎩⎨⎧​Y(Pw​)=max(0,L∗(min(Pw​,Pb​)​−Pa​​))X(Pw​)=max(0,L∗(max(Pw​,Pa​)​1​−Pb​​1​))​where LLL denotes the liquidity of the LP position, and PaP_aPa​ and PbP_bPb​ denote the lower and upper bound of the liquidity provision price range respectively.3.Third, we imply the liquidation price of ETH (PliqP_{liq}Pliq​) such that when the LP position is liquidated when ETH touches such price, the implied liquidation risk margin is the same as that of ETH:Pliq=Pw∗(1+LRMETH)\begin{aligned} {P_{liq}}&={P_w}*\left(1+LRM_{ETH}\right)\\ \end{aligned} Pliq​​=Pw​∗(1+LRMETH​)​Note there is a sanity check that loans should only be allowed if Pliq≤PbP_{liq} \le P_bPliq​≤Pb​. As the LP position has a constant value when ETH price is above PbP_bPb​, liquidating the LP position at PETH=Pliq>PbP_{ETH}=P_{liq}>P_bPETH​=Pliq​>Pb​ is equivalent to doing so at PETH=PbP_{ETH}=P_{b}PETH​=Pb​. Therefore, the actual liquidation risk margin is lower than that of ETH and thus insufficient.4.Finally, we calculated the liquidation price of the LP position when ETH hits such liquidation price, and calculate the liquidation threshold (in percentage) of the LP position as:liq_thldLP=V(Pw)V(Pliq)liq\_thld_{LP}=\frac{V(P_w)}{V(P_{liq})} liq_thldLP​=V(Pliq​)V(Pw​)​Note the liquidation threshold is a useful metric to analyze the risk of the loan. However, the health factor calculation, which dictates the triggering of liquidation, should be based on the ratio between ETH price and liquidation price PliqP_{liq}Pliq​ rather than basing the health factor calculation on the value of the LP itself. When the ETH price moves, depending on the LLL, PaP_aPa​ and PbP_bPb​ of the LP position and ETH spot price, the LP position’s value could stay constant until ETH price drops below a critical level. Therefore, the conventional calculation of health factor may not appropriately reflect the health of a loan when collateralized by the LP token while its underlying ETH price is changing which lead to deterioration of the loan health. The health factor will be calculated as:health_factor=PETHPliq
health\_factor=\frac{P_{ETH}}{P_{liq}}

Specifically, with the currently available borrow credit denoted by CRCRCR and the targeted Uniswap V3 LP token’s collateral factor denoted by CFCFCF, the amount of deposit and borrow for each repetition is projected in the table below:RepetitionDepositBorrow1Supplied Collateral​CRCRCR​2​CRCRCR​​CR∗CFCR*CFCR∗CF​3​CR∗CFCR*CFCR∗CF​​CR∗CF2CR*CF^2CR∗CF2​………​nnn​​CR∗CFn−2CR*CF^{n-2}CR∗CFn−2​​CR∗CFn−1CR*CF^{n-1}CR∗CFn−1​Therefore, the credit limit (i.e. maximum amount of borrowing) can be calculated as the sum of all borrow amounts as projected in the table above when n→∞.n\to\infty.n→∞.​CRmax⁡=lim⁡n→∞∑CR+CR∗CF+CR∗CF2+...+CR∗CFn=CR1−CF\begin{equation} \begin{aligned} CR_{\max}&=\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum CR+CR*CF+CR*CF^2+...+CR*CF^{n} \\ &=\frac{CR}{1-CF} \end{aligned} \end{equation}CRmax​​=n→∞lim​∑CR+CR∗CF+CR∗CF2+...+CR∗CFn=1−CFCR​​​​This means, for a user with currently available borrow credit of CRCRCR and CFCFCF determined given the Uniswap V3 LP token he chooses to provide liquidity to with the borrowed assets from Para Space, rather than leaving the user perform the series of transactions repetitively, we develop a solution for the user such that he can achieve desired leverage with one click.Specifically, The user can choose to borrow any amount up to CR1−CF\frac{CR}{1-CF}1−CFCR​ of value. Such value will then be allocated proportionally to the two underlying assets of the LP position as calculated per eq.

On the page of adding liquidity in Uniswap V3, three factors have to be defined, PaP_aPa​, PbP_bPb​ , and either one of x0x_0x0​ and y0y_0y0​, where x0x_0x0​ and y0y_0y0​ denote the number of XXX and YYY tokens that will be injected into the liquidity provision position.2.Calculate LLL and x0x_0x0​ or y0y_0y0​.

The current credit (i.e. the available amount of borrowing that is enabled by existing collateral) will be considered in conjunction with the additional credit that the leverage buy targets would bring, such that even though the total borrow amount should not exceed the current credit plus the extra borrow credit from collateralizing the leverage bought NFTs. This result in the calculation of credit limit as following:CRmax⁡=CR+∑i=1n(Floor_Pricei∗CFi)CR_{\max}=CR+\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(Floor\_Price_i*CF_i\right) CRmax​=CR+i=1∑n​(Floor_Pricei​∗CFi​)where CRCRCR denotes the current credit, Floor_PriceiFloor\_Price_iFloor_Pricei​ and CFiCF_iCFi​ denote the floor price and collateral factor of the iii-th leverage buy target respectively.Note, any single transaction of NFT could result in a change in the floor price of the collection and by extension every item of NFT within. Therefore, technically CRmax⁡CR_{\max}CRmax​ calculation should consider the foreseeable influence of each leverage buy transaction on the floor price. However, as leverage buy can only result in an increase in floor price (i.e. the floor priced item is bought thus the new floor price becomes the previously the second lowest “buy now” price) without any possibility of lowering the floor price, the calculation of credit limit defined in eq. (1) is a conservative measure.The leverage buy transaction will be facilitated through flashloan. Specifically:1.User defines the items of NFT he intends to purchase through leverage buy. Note the items have to be listed with “Buy Now” prices which will be the transaction prices through the leverage buy function;2.The borrowing amount (value “BBB”) will be calculated per the user-defined list of NFTs to be acquired through leverage buy. Note the amount will not be allowed to be borrowed if it exceeds CRmax⁡CR_{\max}CRmax​.3.A flashloan of ERC20 tokens will be originated from Para Space platform, and the borrowed assets are then used to purchase the list of target NFTs at their “Buy-Now” prices.4.The acquired list of NFTs will be deposited and collateralized on Para Space platform.At the end of the leverage buy transaction, the leverage buyer adds the desired list of NFTs to his asset position (i.e. deposit and collateral) and value “BBB” to his loan position.Without mortgage as a product there would not be a housing market.

The block number of the snapshot in the Ethereum network is 12225000.

Vesting speed depends on the amount of PSWAP burned from Polkaswap usage fees. PSWAP are vested with Strategic Bonus Vesting, where the vested amount is a percentage of the daily amount of PSWAP burned in transaction fees, as shown in the figure below.As you can see, at launch the % of burned PSWAP which is allocated as Strategic Bonus Vesting is 0%, and it increases linearly in 5 years to 55%, and then it will stay constant. The other burned PSWAP is reserved for the SORA Parliament (10%) and as a reward for Liquidity Providers. This reward is similar to the one you get from providing liquidity on Uniswap, namely the 0.3% on every trade.An example that can be useful to clarify:Let's suppose that currently when 100 PSWAP are burned, 81 PSWAP are minted to reward Liquidity Providers, then, 10 PSWAP are minted for the Parliament and 9 PSWAP are minted as a bonus reward. That means that 3 PSWAP (33%) are reserved as a strategic reward for Liquidity Providers, 3 PSWAP (33%) are reserved for buyers from TBC and 3 PSWAP (33%) are reserved for market makers. Every user will receive rewards proportional to their vesting amount.An important consequence of this design is that it assures that a sudden supply of tokens will not immediately flood the market, and gives clear forward guidance about the supply of tokens in circulation, which is expected to remain constant.VALidator rewards ​Users may stake with SORA validators in order to get VAL rewards.

WARNING Rewards expire after 84 eras. On SORA , that's about 21 days.","Rewards ​Theory ​Users are incentivised to provide liquidity, use the SORA network, and support the set of network validators. There are different reward types depending on the activity.Let's describe all the currently available rewards in detail:Rewards for Market MakersLP Farming Bonus rewardsRewards for buying from the TBCLP feesVesting VAL for XOR erc-20 holdersVALidator rewardsHere is a quick summary of every reward.Rewards for Market Makers ​Polkaswap is distributing an amount of PSWAP proportional to trade volume to market makers who conduct at least 500 transactions per month, with a per-transaction amount of 1 XOR or more (excluding transaction costs).LP Farming Bonus rewards ​Polkaswap users will earn PSWAP tokens for providing liquidity in any XOR-paired pool. If you contribute to the XOR-VAL, XOR-PSWAP, XOR-DAI, or XOR-ETH pools, your reward is doubled.Rewards for buying from the TBC ​A token bonding curve is a smart contract that takes one token as an input and outputs another, using a mathematical formula. A token bonding curve can automatically issue, sell, and buy tokens at prices that are determined by the mathematical functions used.The PSWAP rewards to be earned are calculated exponentially as a function of current reserves: the lower the reserves at a given time, the greater your rewards for helping boost them.LP Fees ​The first way to earn PSWAP rewards on Polkaswap is to provide liquidity on the DEX with XOR and any other token. Liquidity providers get 0.3% of each swap in fees so that they will earn PSWAP for providing liquidity to the pool. Then more users trade, the more liquidity providers get.Vesting VAL for XOR erc-20 holders ​Before the SORA launch, a XOR erc-20 holder snapshot was made. The block number of the snapshot in the Ethereum network is 12225000.

In order for a NFT to be pooled, it has to be divisible, so you can sell or buy only a fraction of it. Pooling NFT works like any other liquidity pool on Polkaswap, and it also provides the same advantages. The steps to pool your NFT are as follows:From the NFT preview within your wallet, click on the 💧 icon.Select the amount of XOR to pair with your NFT. You can also add more than one NFT to the pool if you want to add more XOR.Double-check the details and, if everything is correct, click confirm.Your Polkadot.js extension will require you to sign a transaction as well. Once it is confirmed, you will be able to see your NFT pool within the Pool section in Polkaswap.Remember that you can pool more than one NFT at a time (as many of the same token as you may have in your wallet).You can also pool your NFT directly from the Pool section in Polkaswap.You can either add liquidity or create a pair. When you create a pair with an NFT, the flow will be the same as pooling an NFT directly. There is a step in common with adding liquidity to an existing pool, which is the initial token selection.Click on Custom to see your NFT and select the one you have decided to pool (or add liquidity to an existing pool).Like before, select the token and the amount of liquidity (in this case 1 NFT and its equivalent in XOR), then click on Supply. In this example, we add more liquidity to the WINDTUL and XOR pool:You will receive a confirmation from your wallet and the token will be part of a liquidity pool.Alternatively, you can also add or remove liquidity from an NFT pair directly from the drop-down menu in the Polkaswap pool view:Swapping Tokens ​Finally, you can also swap an NFT for other tokens from the preview screen;Click the swap button:You will be presented with the familiar Polkaswap swapping interface that will allow you to trade your NFT for other tokens.INFOBe aware that swapping your NFT like this will come at a significant price impact.Choose the token to swap your NFT to:Similar to the other functions, review the transaction summary and, if you're happy with the outcome, click swap and sign the transaction in Polkadot.js extension.WARNINGYou can also buy NFT using the swap function, however, you need to add the desired NFT to your wallet as a custom asset.

At the moment, you can only mint and share NFT. Swapping, liquidity and bridging functions are not available yet.The other item needed is a file to mint. You can use an IPFS link or you can upload the file locally.Via Polkaswap ​Minting Tokens ​Access Polkaswap and navigate to account.Click on the circular icon on the top right corner of the account view:Select the NFT tab and get ready to mint your first NFT on the SORA network!In the create NFT interface you will be able to mint your non-fungible NFTs.Here is an overview of the available fields:To add the file, you can use an IPFS link, or alternatively, you can upload a file from your local storage.You will then need to assign a Token symbol with maximum 7 chars. Keep this in mind as you will need the token symbol later when you import the NFT to your wallet.Token name is similar to the token symbol, but has a 33 char limit instead.Token Description answers question like: what's your token about? what makes your token special? You can either let your imagination run free here, or add a generic description.In the Token supply specify how many tokens you want to mint.Use toggle switches to choose if you want to mint more tokens based on this one (Extensible supply), or if you want your NFT to have the ability to divide into fractional parts (Divisible). More information on this option is coming soon.Now that you know what the NFT interface looks like and what information you need to provide, let’s mint an NFT!Walkthrough ​For this example, we will be minting the Temple of the God of the Wind, from the Tulum Mayan ruins. We have an IPFS link for the image too.Paste the URL in the IPFS link field and let the image load.Once the image is visible, add the token symbol, name, description, and how many copies you would like to mint.Choose if you want to mint more tokens based on this. If you want the token to be divisible, make sure you have enough funds for the transaction fee and click Create NFT.INFOIf you want to pool an NFT, it has to be Divisible.On a confirmation screen, double-check that all the info input was correct, then click confirm and sign the transaction with your wallet. You will be required to sign using your Polkadot.js browser add-on.Once the NFT has been minted, navigate to the Activity tab within your account view and make sure the asset appears as registered.You have successfully minted an NFT!But you still can’t see it within your assets... This is where the token symbol comes in.Adding Tokens to Your Wallet ​Navigate back to the Assets tab within your account view, then scroll to the bottom of the list and click the Add Asset button.Search for the asset from the list using the token symbol you assigned, then select the token.As soon as you select it, you will be served with a disclaimer. Always make sure that the tokens you add to your account are legitimate.Once you toggle the accept switch, click Add Asset.Your NFT will now appear within your list of assets!Viewing Tokens ​What can you do with NFTs for now? Here is a quick rundown.From your account view, click on the arrow to see the visual content of your NFT.This will open a preview of your NFT. From here you can do things like send the token to another address, copy the token address, or remove the asset from your wallet:Sending Tokens ​You can send your freshly minted token to other addresses! In order to do that, you need your friend’s address and some XOR for the transfer fees.Click on the send button from the NFT view:A confirmation will appear requesting an address, and the amount of tokens to send. This will also display the network fee.Make sure everything is correct and click send.Confirm that the recipient address is correct one more time, confirm and sign the transaction.And that is it!

Open the list of transactions and filter it using the PoolXYK module parameter and deposit_liquidity call for providing liquidity or withdraw_liquidity call for removing liquidity.,"Liquidity Operations ​Everything about pool XYK liquidity provision in SORA.Theory ​To Polkaswap means to exchange (swap) tokens on Polkaswap, Polkaswap is a non-custodial, cross-chain AMM DEX protocol for swapping tokens, Polkaswap removes trusted intermediaries and provides the opportunity for faster trading, and Polkaswap also combines multiple liquidity sources under a common liquidity aggregation algorithm, operating completely on-chain, in a trustless and decentralized way.XYK Pools are managed by the community. Anyone can provide liquidity to any pool. Liquidity pools (XYK pools) are explained in this video on the Finemtaics YouTube channel. It's recommended to watch it in order to understand how Pools work in general.You can provide liquidity in an XYK pool so that users are able to exchange tokens. There are three main cases here:The pool doesn't exist and you'll be the first liquidity provider (LP).The pool exists and you're adding liquidity.You already have a share in the pool and you'd like to remove liquidity.Every liquidity provider gets PSWAP rewards for providing liquidity. Rewards are the incentive for users to provide liquidity. There are two types of rewards:Rewards paid from LP feesLP Farming bonus rewardsRewards paid from LP fees are distributed every day for each liquidity pool. For example, if you have a share in three liquidity pools, then your rewards that are available to claim will be updated twice a day.LP Farming bonus rewards are distributed every six hours.Along with the network fee in XOR, all three cases require an additional fee: liquidity provider fee (LP fee). The LP fee is used to incentivize liquidity providers to supply liquidity in liquidity pools. Liquidity pools are described in this article.INFOImportant: before providing liquidity read about the risks involved here.In order to see the total pooled amounts, check the tool Ceres has built https://tools.cerestoken.io/#/tokens.Practice ​TIPWe recommend using the SORA testnet for practice exercises.

Keep in mind that all trading pairs in Polkaswap must contain XOR and another token. That's why the XOR token is preselected and can't be changed.Select the second token for the trading pair.Oooops! The trading pair for XOR-VAL is already created. It means that someone has already created a pool with this trading pair and provided the liquidity.INFOPay attention when you're the first liquidity provider. The ratio of tokens will set the price of this pool.Enter the deposit amounts for each token:Let's describe the parameters:XOR per SAT is the price of XOR in SAT tokens if a user will trade using this poolSAT per XOR is the price of SAT in XOR tokens if a user will trade using this poolNetwork fee is the fee for processing the transactionShare of Pool is the percentage of your tokens in the poolIf everything is ok, confirm and sign the transaction.Now you can see your pool share on the Pool page:Providing Liquidity to an Existing Liquidity Pool ​Via Polkaswap ​There are two options where you can add liquidity:If you already have a share in a specific pool, you can click Add liquidity on the pool details.If you'd like to provide liquidity to a pool where you don't have a share, then click Add liquidity on the Pool page.The next steps are pretty much the same. If you select the pool where you already have a share, then the token pair will be preselected, otherwise, you should select the tokens by yourself.Select the token pair.Enter the amount of source asset or destination asset.INFOIf you enter the amount of a source asset, the amount of destination asset will be calculated according to the pool math.
