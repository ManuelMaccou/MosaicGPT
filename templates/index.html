          To improve risk management for digital currencies, especially in the context of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), you can take the following measures:

1. Develop a Comprehensive Framework: Establish a risk management framework that covers the entire lifecycle of a CBDC, from design and development to implementation and operation. This framework should address process-related risks, technological risks, third-party risks, and business continuity.

2. Understand Technology Risks: With CBDCs often built on emerging technologies like distributed ledger technology (DLT), it is crucial to understand the unique cyber risks involved. Consider developing or adopting cyber security frameworks tailored to DLT and enhancing your understanding of potential threat vectors.

3. Engage with Private Sector and Agencies: Foster partnerships with the private sector and government agencies to promote best practices, share risk models, and build resilience against operational disruptions.

4. Perform Due Diligence and Audit Rights: When working with third parties, ensure thorough due diligence processes and establish audit rights to assess their operations routinely.

5. Address Anonymity Risks: For token-based CBDCs that use private/public key mechanisms, mitigate risks associated with key theft or loss and potential avenues for money laundering or terrorist financing.

6. Monitor Consumer Trends: As consumer comfort with traditional money continues to evolve, keep an eye on these trends to anticipate challenges in CBDC adoption and prepare strategies to enhance consumer trust in digital currencies.

7. Anticipate and Manage Liquidity Risks: Be wary of risks such as bank disintermediation, where digital currencies could lead to a rapid switch from bank deposits, potentially prompting bank runs in times of financial stress.

8. Data Privacy and Asset Security: Prioritize the protection of consumer data and secure the digital assets to maintain the trust of users, which is crucial for the adoption and success of any CBDC.

9. Continuous Learning and Improvement: Adapt to the dynamic landscape of digital currencies by continuously incorporating feedback, analyzing new threats, and improving the CBDC's design and risk management processes.
